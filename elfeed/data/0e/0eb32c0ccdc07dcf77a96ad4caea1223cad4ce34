<p>Well I have been using the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com">Pomodoro TechniqueÂ®</a> for a few months
now. The idea is to work 25 minutes non stop and take a pause for 5
minutes. I think it's a very good idea for me as my mind gets numb
after too much work. It is also a good regimen for time off. I find that
5 minutes is over very quickly when I am lurking in IRC. The hardest
bit is to tell my co-workers that I don't want to be interrupted... I
highly recommend to all IT workers.</p>
