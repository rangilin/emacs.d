<p>You need to run exim as root. So edit Local/Makefile thus:</p>

<pre class="example">
EXIM_USER=mailnull
# FIXED_NEVER_USERS=root (comment out)
</pre>

<p>In your configuration file set:</p>

<pre class="example">
exim_user = root
exim_group = mail
</pre>

<p>And, hey presto, it works! I hope it will save you the many hours it
took me to figure it out.</p>
