<p>I’ve added another <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Podcasts.html">recommended podcast to my list</a>, this
one a is a treasure if you enjoy good fiction. <a href="http://www.reallylikethisbook.com/">Why I Really Like This
Book</a> is a quirky sail through the lesser known waters of English
Literature. The pilot is Kate Macdonald, who teaches English
Literature but was frustrated at the limited range of books she could
cover. Each podcast spends ten minutes or so exploring a single
suggested book. Her first series was a random alphabetical wander, now
she’s taken to talking about sets of five books with a common theme. Recent
sets include Five Appalling Fictional Women and Five Classic Detective
Novels. If you’re looking for ideas for books to curl up with, this is
an excellent source of suggestions.</p>
