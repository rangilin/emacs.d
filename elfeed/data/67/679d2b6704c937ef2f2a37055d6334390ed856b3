<p>My colleague Brandon Byars has been involved in several projects in large enterprises where they are trying to upgrade and replace their legacy systems. A strategy that’s been useful in these situations is using REST-style web-services as an integration mechanism. Brandon is writing an article to discuss the lessons learned from this, which talks less about things like HATEOS and more on the role of environment management, versioning, and contract evolution. This first edition of the article talks about the importance of defining logical environments, and he’ll be publishing more sections to the article over the next few weeks.</p>
