many of my interests and opinions (and is an excellent source of ideas
for me to clip). In 2009-10 he wrote a <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-eaed1/index.html">series of fifteen
articles</a> for IBM developerWorks which dug deeper into the
question of evolutionary architecture and design. His topics included
Test Driven Development, leveraging reusable code, refactoring towards
design and Domain-Specific Languages.</p>

<p>Now he’s followed on from this and recorded a <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/video/-/9781449314439">video workshop on Agile
Engineering Practices</a> for
O’Reilly that’s available on safari books online. These cover much of
the topics that make evolutionary design possible, including
Test-Driven Design, automation, and testing strategies.</p>
