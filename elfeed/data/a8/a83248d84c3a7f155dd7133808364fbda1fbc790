methods before they were fashionable. They have spent many years helping
organizations explore agile development and I’ve always found their
opinions worth listening to. When I get requests to review articles I rarely
have time to read them, but a recent request by this pair piqued
my interest.</p>

<p>When I read their draft on the stages of agile fluency, I immediately
offerred to publish it on my site. The article looks at how teams
pass through four stages of fluency with agile methods. Each stage
brings benefits, but demands investment. Not all teams should go
through all the stages. The model they’ve come up with is nicely
simple and resonates with tales told by my colleagues. I think it
provides a good framework for thinking about the style of agile
development you are at and where you want to be.</p>
