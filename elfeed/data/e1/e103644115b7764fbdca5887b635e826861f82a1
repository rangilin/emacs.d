<p>Things have changed in bzr that made my compilation of slime fails.
The error message looked like this:</p>

<pre class="example">
slime-repl.el:19:13:Error: Don't know how to compile nil
</pre>

<p>Stefan Monnier gave me the clue:</p>

<p>&quot;Apparently, some of the code in slime-repl.el ends up calling
(byte-compile &lt;functionname&gt;) where &lt;functionname&gt; is a function
that's not yet defined. Earlier, Emacs would just silently ignore such
erroneous situations.&quot;</p>

<p>So I just removed the following chunk in slime.el:</p>

<pre class="src">
(<span style="color: #8b008b; background-color: #b9babd;">require</span> '<span style="color: #00688b; background-color: #b9babd;">bytecomp</span>)
(<span style="color: #8b008b; background-color: #b9babd;">let</span> ((byte-compile-warnings '()))
  (mapc #'byte-compile
        '(slime-alistify
          slime-log-event
          slime-events-buffer etc...
</pre>

<p>And hey, presto, it compiles again! Thanks Stefan, I would have never
found the solution on my own.</p>
