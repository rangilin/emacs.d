<p>I got tired of people's name being highlighted red when composing
e-mail with flyspell. So I wrote bbdb-spell that exports peoples'
first and last name from bbdb to aspell custom dictionaries.</p>

<p>You need to set the variable ivan-bbdb-aspell-dictionary to a list of
personal dictionaries. Then run M-x ivan-bbdb-export-aspell.</p>
