<p>Getting things to work in Linux kernel 2.6: I can burn CD again. I
removed the ide-scsi emulation option but I forgot to add &quot;Include
IDE/ATAPI CDROM support&quot; option back in the kernel. Doh! It took me
too long to figure this one out!</p>

<p>I need to set the following variable to <code>sbp2</code> so that my external
firewire drive works: <code>serialize_io=1</code>.</p>

<p>I was surprised that my options set in the directory <code>/etc/modutils</code>
would not work anymore. I had to put it in <code>/etc/modprobe.d</code> instead,
run <code>update-modules</code> and it worked as usual. It might be a bug in
sarge...</p>
