<p>The problem with Emacs blogs is one can never have enough of them (especially the good ones).</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to draw my readers attention to two new blogs:</p>

<h3>lunarsite</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.lunaryorn.com/">lunarsite</a> is not exactly new (it was
started in March 2014), but I don&#8217;t think enough people have come
across it, so I&#8217;m mentioning it here anyway. It&#8217;s operated by one of
the most prolific members of the Emacs community in recent years - the
great <a href="http://www.lunaryorn.com/pages/about.html">Sebastian Wiesner</a>
(of <code>flycheck</code> and <code>cask</code> fame).</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of writing your first major mode - you&#8217;ll find some
great advice there.</p>

<h3>Endless Parentheses</h3>

<p><a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless Parentheses</a> is a brand new blog started by
<a href="https://github.com/Bruce-Connor">Arthur Malabarba</a>. It&#8217;s dedicated to
concise posts on improving your Emacs productivity.</p>

<p>The content so far is similar to the articles I write here, so if you like <code>Emacs Redux</code>
you&#8217;ll likely enjoy <code>Endless Parentheses</code> as well.</p>
