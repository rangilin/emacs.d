<h3>To: Teachers of all programming languages</h3>

<p>Over the past year, I have seen the code of many students who are working toward a degree that requires them to take a programming language class of some sort. One thing all these code bases had in common was commentsâ€”useless comments.</p>

<p>I believe that it is good to know what a comment looks like. I also believe that it is good to know how to write a comment (just in case). I do not, however, believe that it is good to write a comment for every single line of code. Furthermore, I am strongly against the practice of requiring students to comment their code extensively and <em>penalizing</em> them for <em>not</em> commenting their code.</p>

<p>Warning: the following is based on a real-life experience of a student in a CS course. His grade was adversely affected by some of the code you are about to see.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">appleCount</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="c1">// an int that stores the count of apples</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>&quot;We get a point taken off for every variable that isn&#39;t commented.&quot;</em></p>

<p>That is the response I received from one student after I asked why he had to write a comment to explain that <code>int appleCount</code> is an int that stores the count of apples.</p>

<p>Playing the devil&#39;s advocate and trying to come up with some really good reasons why students may be required to comment every single variable that they write, I could only think of two, each of them being easily dismissible.</p>

<ol>
<li>It helps teachers read the code.</li>
<li>It forces students to think more about what they&#39;re doing.</li>
</ol>

<h3>It helps the teacher</h3>

<p>Yes, some students write nasty code. Yes, some students write code that is nearly impossible to read. No, a variable declaring an <code>int</code> named <code>appleCount</code> is not nasty code, nor is it impossible to read. On the contrary, it is quite self-explanatory and needs no further clarification. The additional comment provides absolutely no value to the teacher reading the code.</p>

<h3>It forces students to think more</h3>

<p>Students just beginning to pick up programming already have a lot to think about.</p>

<p>For beginners, writing even the most trivial program already comes with a truckload of things to consider. Adding on the requirement of commenting &quot;every single variable&quot; is anything but helpful.</p>

<p>For non-beginners who already understand programming basics, being forced to think about &quot;what else should I comment&quot; is also anything but helpful. Instead, their efforts can be directed toward things like, &quot;Which variables have bad names?,&quot; or &quot;Which part of this code is unclear?&quot;</p>

<h3>So what can teachers do instead?</h3>

<p>I can imagine some folks arguing for comments being necessary in situations like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="c1">// integer counter for apples</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>What is necessary in this situation is a better name:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">counterForApples</span><span class="o">;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The latter example is perfectly sufficient for communicating to a reader what the variable is for.</p>

<p>If a student were to submit a piece of code that looks like the former example, then sure, go ahead and take off a point or two. However, don&#39;t do it on the grounds that the student didn&#39;t comment their variable. If you do that, then the student will focus their efforts on &quot;comment everything.&quot; Instead, take off points on the grounds that the variable name was unclear. This will make the student focus their efforts on &quot;what else can I make more clear?&quot;</p>
