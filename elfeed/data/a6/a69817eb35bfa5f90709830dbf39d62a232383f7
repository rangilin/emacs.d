<p>I use appointment with org. I find that a global time delay for each
appointments is inconvenient. For example I need to be warned an hour
before an appointment downtown and only 5 minutes for a meeting at
work. I have hacked appt.el to keep track of a delay for each
appointment. The function appt-add is compatible with the old appt and
the change has been accepted upstream.</p>
