<p>Here's how to obliterate files from the repository. Note that using
the subversion <code>remove</code> command will not remove it from your
repository. I had to use it as I noticed I put friends' e-mail
addresses in by accident.</p>


<p>The following commands move the repository to a backup location, dumps
the database in a file. Finally I remove the file <code>.nobunce</code> from the
repository. You can specify multiple files to remove.</p>

<pre class="example">
mv subversion subversion.bak
svnadmin dump subversion.bak &gt; dump
svndumpfilter exclude trunk/ivan/.nobounce &lt; dump &gt; dump.filter
</pre>


<p>Now I recreate a fresh repository and load the new new dump file minus
the offending file. You can delete <code>subversion.bak</code> when you feel
confident that your new repository is working.</p>

<pre class="example">
svnadmin create --fs-type fsfs subversion
svnadmin load subversion &lt; dump.filter
</pre>

<p>According to the subversion documentation, there will be a command
called <code>obliterate</code> that will do the above without the hassle.</p>
