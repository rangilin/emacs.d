<p>A few days ago I moved this site from <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to <a href="https://uberspace.de">Uberspace</a>, a unique little shared hosting provider from Germany with a large feature set and an innovative payment concept: They let you pay as much (or as little) as you want for their entire service, which includes generous storage limits, unlimited mail accounts and addresses via IMAP, POP and SMTP, hosting of web applications in various languages, full shell access, backups, and last but not least outstanding technical support and a great admin team.</p>
<p>The source of this site is still on Github, of course, even though Uberspace also offers Git hosting<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Github is simply the best, and I could keep most of my setup this way. Notably, I’m still using <a href="https://travis-ci.org/lunaryorn/blog">Travis CI</a> to build, test and deploy the site, but instead of pushing to Github Pages the HTML goes to a special repository on my Uberspace account, which has hooks in place to copy the HTML files to where Apache can find them.</p>
<p>All this changes nothing for you, with two exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Github address (<code>http://lunaryorn.github.io</code>) doesn’t work anymore. This shouldn’t affect you, though, since this site always used <a href="http://www.lunaryorn.com" class="uri">http://www.lunaryorn.com</a> as the primary address, so you should never have encountered the Github Pages address anyway.</li>
<li>I replaced Google Analytics with a self-hosted <a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a> instance, which aggressively anonymizes all collected data, and let’s you opt-out from analytics with the standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a> mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also moved my mail from GMail to Uberspace, which lets me use addresses on a custom domain. My new mail address is listed in my <a href="https://github.com/lunaryorn">Github profile</a>. The old GMail address is forwarded to my new address, of course, but I’d encourage you to use my new address right away.</p>
<p>In the process of migrating my mail, I also setup a separate mail address for mails regarding <a href="http://flycheck.readthedocs.org">Flycheck</a>, which you can find on <a href="https://github.com/flycheck">Flycheck’s profile</a> page.</p>
<p>Apart from some little nuisances, and one or two pitfalls, including some very serious fights with passphrase input in OpenSSH, the whole migration went quite smoothly, and was indeed much easier than I had feared.</p>
<p>Ironically, I had also set up my own <a href="http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki">Tiny Tiny RSS</a> instance to replace Feedly for news readings, just in time for today’s <a href="http://blog.feedly.com/2014/06/11/denial-of-service-attack/">DDoS attack on Feedly</a>, which consequently left me unimpressed :) The effort of migrating has already doubly paid off.</p>
