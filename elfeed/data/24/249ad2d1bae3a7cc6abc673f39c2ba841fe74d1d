<p>We started with a talk by the current org maintainer Bastien. I think
the most promising feature he is working on is org-bot. It's a way for
someone to manipulate somebody else org file via ERC. I think it's
quite exciting: this may lead the way for org to become multi user.</p>

<p>I gave a short talk in the beginning of the afternoon on how I
implement GTD with org. We then split up in small group. Isabelle,
Thierry and Vincent-Xavier took care of translating the reference card
in french. I heard that Bastien and Julien specified how to implement
numbered lists. Kaze, Kinouchou and others were working on usage and
workflow. I showed Bernard, Mohamed and Vivien how fun it was to
program in elisp.</p>

<p>We then went to a restaurant and had a good time. I think everyone
involved felt that their time was put to good use. I hope we will do
this again.</p>
