<p>It is quite annoying in Linux that the name of a network interface
is unpredictable. I added wireless support on my laptop. The wired
interface changed from eth0to
eth1and caused all sorts of problem.</p>

<p>The package ifrenamesolves the problem nicely.</p>

<p><code>apt-get install ifrename</code></p>

<p>Next add the the mac address of each network card in
/etc/iftab:</p>

<pre class="example">
wire mac 00:40:45:24:A0:DC
wifi mac 00:0C:F1:09:2B:27
</pre>

<p>You'll need to reference you card as <code>wire</code> and <code>wifi</code> in
<code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>. Things will break when you change network
card, but that's a small price to pay for some sanity in network
interface names.</p>
