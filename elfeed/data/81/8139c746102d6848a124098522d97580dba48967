<p>So my server crashed the other day. For the anecdote, my e-mail spam
filter was going in an infinite loop with Richard Stallman's filter.</p>

<p>A fork bomb is when you are spawning too many process. The easiest way
to create one is to write a script shell that calls itself. Notice if
your server becomes unusable.</p>

<p>This is not a good thing. It could lead to a denial of service. It's
so simple to fix I wonder why it is not done by default on Debian.</p>

<p>Edit /etc/security/limits.conf</p>
