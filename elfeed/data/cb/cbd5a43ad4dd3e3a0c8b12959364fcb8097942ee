<p>Is your modeline chock full of minor-mode abbreviations and cruft?</p>

  After a quick <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code class="small">package-install diminish</code>, you too can
  have the pleasure of using a lot of minor modes, without those minor
  modes making a mess of the modeline. Mmm.

  As for diminish.el itself, it contains the most beautifully poetic
  code commentary of all time. Here's an excerpt:

<div class="quote">
  <blockquote>
    "When we diminish a mode, we are saying we want it to continue doing its
    work for us, but we no longer want to be reminded of it.  It becomes a
    night worker, like a janitor; it becomes an invisible man; it remains a
    component, perhaps an important one, sometimes an indispensable one, of
    the mechanism that maintains the day-people's world, but its place in
    their thoughts is diminished, usually to nothing.  As we grow old we
    diminish more and more such thoughts, such people, usually to nothing."
