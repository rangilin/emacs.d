<p>It's been now two years that I use zsh as my interactive shell. Twice
I had a coworker ask me why I use it. Since I am not a very good
salesman, I could not tell on the spot why I switched. I will try
explaining what made me a convert.</p>

<p>The command I like the most is M-p. I can type 'tar' then use M-p to
go to the previous use of that command. I use it now all the time
instead of C-r.</p>

<p>In a similar vein the command M-. copy the previous last argument.
Pressing it repeatedly moves to previous commands.</p>

<p>To switch directory I just type the name of the directory without cd.
(You might notice a trend here that I love saving keystrokes!).
Unfortunately it's not on by default. I have the following line in my
<a href="zshrc.txt">.zshrc</a>:</p>

<pre class="example">
setopt auto_cd
</pre>

<p>There are other goodies such as auto correct, extended glob, a great
completion system (compinit), built in regular expression, etc... I
won't get into it. It suffices to say that zsh is choke full of
features and will do what you want it to.</p>

<p>I have published my <a href="zshrc.txt">.zshrc</a> if you are curious to see it. I have a ssh
wrapper function. I use it to connect to servers that don't belong to
me. On the server I have two files (.zshrc and .vimrc) that I put in a
hidden directory (~/.ivan). With this technique I don't mess up the
system administrator preference such as vim color.</p>

<p>The other noteworthy function is zshrc_build_path. It sets up a PATH
environment by checking that each directory exists. This keeps PATH
tidy which is useful since I juggle many machines. I used to have a
Python script that would generate a .bashrc, it was gross.</p>

<p>Although I don't use it I know that people like <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">Oh My Zsh!</a> so I am
sure it's worth checking out too.</p>
