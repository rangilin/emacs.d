I was asked to kick off this track with an introductory talk for an hour giving an outline to the important issues in thinking about NoSQL. I talk about the origins of NoSQL, forms of NoSQL data models, the way many NoSQL databases consider the problem of consistency, and the importance of Polyglot Persistence. I was pretty happy with how this turned out and think it’s a good way to spend an hour if you want to start a journey in understanding NoSQL.</p>

<p>There is also a video of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=191kCkNya5Q&amp;list=PLEx5khR4g7PJmH05qNUmmo8WzSSaJIzLj&amp;index=7">panel of NoSQL vendors</a> that I participated on. This wasn’t a great discussion - lots of talking past each other, but maybe worth a look for people who are already into the NoSQL world.</p>
