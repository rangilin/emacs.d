I love intuitive keymaps. Some are so perfect, you just can't avoid
mouthing the words every time you hit that blissful combo. A wizard
murmuring an incantation under his breath as his fingers draw the
arcane patterns.

The following keymap toggles some options which tend to be useful
throughout a session.

There are eight keys being defined there, most of which aren't even
used every day, but I know I'll never forget a single one. That is the
beauty of mnemonics.
</p>

<p>
Doesn't <i>"Emacs, toggle column"</i> just roll off your tongue as you're
typing <kbd>C-x t c</kbd>? I feel like I'm commanding the
strands of reality, but that could just be my D&amp;D past taking the
better of me. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Also note: The manual recommends <kbd>C-c</kbd> for user keys, but I like using <kbd>C-x</kbd> for global keys and using <kbd>C-c</kbd> for mode-specific keys.</i></p>
