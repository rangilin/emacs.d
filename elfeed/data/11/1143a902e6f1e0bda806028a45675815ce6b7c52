<p>Today&#8217;s screencast is on editing. We discuss basic editing as well as a handful of commands that allow you to manipulate text efficiently.</p>

<p>The H.264 version of the video for iOS devices is at <a href="http://archive.org/download/EmacsMovies/03-episode-editing.mkv">http://archive.org/download/EmacsMovies/03-episode-editing.mkv</a>.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="http://emacsmovies.org/assets/douglass2.txt">sample file</a> which I used for the presentation.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> There are two more keys which I wanted to mention but missed. The first is <code>C-backspace</code> which deletes the previous word. It is like <code>backspace</code> but for the previous word. The other is the numeric prefix command which we saw in the navigation video. If you want to, for example, draw a line of <code>-</code> signs, you can type <code>M-40 -</code> and Emacs will repeat the insertion of <code>-</code> 40 times creating a line.</p>
