<p>If you’re a subscriber to Safari Books Online, you will soon see a
copy of a <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780133036138">rough cut of NoSQL Distilled</a>. This morning I said it
was available, but I’ve since learned that my Safari account has
special privileges, so I was seeing it but others cannot. We expect it
to be available in the next couple of days for everyone who has an
account that includes rough cuts.</p>

<p>It’s a rough cut, so it’s still early in the production process, with
few copy-edits done. But it gives you an early chance to take a look
at the text and to pass on comments.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.safaribooksonline.com/">Safari Books Online</a> is an online library that gives access
to lots of software books, including those of Pearson and O’Reilly.
They have various levels of subscription, only some of which include
rough cuts. For example there are two levels of individual
subscription: bookshelf and library. Only the (more expensive) library
individual subscription gives access to rough cuts.</p>

<p>I’m sorry for any confusion I’ve caused by my premature announcement.</p>
