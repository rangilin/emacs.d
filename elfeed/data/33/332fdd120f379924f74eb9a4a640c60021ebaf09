<p>Pramod and I have put together a short <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/nosql-intro">infodeck</a> (pdf) outlining the reasons
why NoSQL databases are an important new dish on the software
development menu. Itâ€™s directed at non-technical managers and
customers to provide an outline of why the data world has seen this
new entrant and some direction as to the kinds of projects which
should give them a closer look.</p>
