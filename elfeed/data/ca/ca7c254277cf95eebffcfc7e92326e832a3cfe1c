<p>On my long flight down to Australia recently I dug into a copy of
<a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</a>. I spent less than seven hours
on it, but found it a worthwhile read. He takes a lightening tour
through seven languages. It’s not enough to go into much depth on any
them, but it is enough to get a rough feel what’s interesting about
them. I’d particularly recommend it if you are just starting to
explore beyond the curly-brace languages that dominate so much of
current programming.</p>

<p>One thing I particularly appreciate about pragprog books is that you
get access to electronic versions in multiple formats. This book
worked very well on the Kindle, despite the small screen.</p>
