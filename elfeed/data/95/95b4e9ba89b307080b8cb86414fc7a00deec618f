<p>What are those line numbers for anyway?</p>

  I don't have line numbers visible in the fringe of my Emacs. If I
  want to go to a line number, that is usually because it is
  referenced in an error message somewhere. Showing them all the time
  is just noise to me.

  Still, many people want line numbers visible. I guess that is
  because they use them for navigation. This snippet shows line
  numbers temporarily just when you're going to a line number
  with <code>goto-line</code>.

  Notice the nice <code>remap</code>-trick in the key binding. It will
  remap all key bindings from <code>goto-line</code> to
  <code>goto-line-with-feedback</code>. Neat!
