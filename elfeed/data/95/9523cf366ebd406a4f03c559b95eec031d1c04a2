<p>If you're using XP style planning, you need to get rapid consensus
  estimates from developers. Throwing the estimates lets you quickly
  tell when developers have same similar views on an estimate (so you
  can note it and move on) or if there is disagreement (when you need
  to talk about the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UserStory.html">UserStory</a> in more detail.</p>

<p>Here's the basic sequence. The customer puts together the list of
  stories that need to estimated. With each story:</p>

<ul>
<li>The customer briefly describes the stories to the developers</li>

<li>Developers ask clarifying questions about the story. They
    shouldn't discuss technical issues about how to implement, just
    ask about scope from the customer's point of view.</li>

<li>On the count of three, the developers show fingers to indicate
    their estimate of how many <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/XpVelocity.html">NUTs</a> there are in the story. I call
    this a thrown estimate because you can use the same style of pacing
    throws that you use
    for <a href="http://www.worldrps.com/gbasics.html">Rock Paper
    Scissors.</a>.</li>

<li>If most estimates are similar the scribe notes down the
estimate. If you get a significant variation in estimate then you
should discuss the story further - bringing in the technical issues of
how to implement it.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use different conventions for how many fingers to
  use. One project I've seen uses 1 or 2 fingers to indicate 1 or 2
  NUTs and three fingers to indicate the story is too big and needs
  splitting up. Another group uses fingers for 1-4 NUTs and five
  fingers to indicate it's too large. Notice that it's important to
  have a convention to say that a story has a problem and can't be
  estimated - most often because it's too big, but also if it can't be
  tested or there's some other problem.</p>

<p>Teams using this report that they are able to estimate stories at
  a very rapid rate, avoiding much discussion on stories that are
  straightforward to estimate and concentrating time on those that are
  more problematic. This keeps everyone engaged in the estimating
  process. It also helps that it's fun.</p>
