<p>GTD enforces a weekly review. I used to do it with great zeal and it
would take about two hours. I did it in two phases: refile things in
my &quot;in&quot; box to folders and then go through each folders and classify
action in sub folders.</p>

<p>I have streamlined the process the following ways. First I am using
only folders. This saves classifying time.</p>

<p>Secondly I am using less next actions. I have about 6 next actions
actions ongoing. I used to have one for each sub sections and was
faced with a mind numbing list of next actions.</p>

<p>Lastly I am doing personal and professional actions on different days.
Doing it all at once was taking too much time. The context didn't feel
right either. I didn't feel like doing professional stuff at home and
vice versa.</p>

<p>I am also breaking the two minutes rule. If I feel like doing it I do
it straight away and then get back to reviewing later.</p>

<p>All in all I must be spending 30 minutes a week on reviewing. I feel
like I am wasting less time and staying more in focus.</p>
