<p>These are the topics I&#8217;m planning to cover in the first <em>section</em>. I&#8217;m posting this up to solicit feedback on content as well as order</p>

<ol>
<li>Registers and bookmarks</li>
<li>A bunch of minor modes (auto-fill, flyspell etc.)</li>
<li>Basic customisation (probably a multi part episode)

<ul>
<li>Very basic elisp.</li>
<li>Simple settings like colours, font size etc.</li>
<li>Minor modes</li>
<li>Mode hooks</li>
<li>Key bindings</li>
<li>The <code>customize</code> system</li>
<li>Organising your <code>.emacs</code> file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keyboard macros</li>
</ol>


<p>I think this should cover it. I might make changes based on how the episodes turn out but this sounds like a decent starting point.</p>

<p>The other three sections will cover applications like <code>dired</code> etc., programming modes and utilities and finally, elisp. I&#8217;ll worry about those when I get there.</p>

<p>This is a call for feedback so please let me know.</p>
