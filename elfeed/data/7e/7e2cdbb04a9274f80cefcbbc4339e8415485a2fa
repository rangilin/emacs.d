<p>
  Backup files are so very annoying, until the day they save your
  hide. That's when you don't want to look back and say "Man, I
  really shouldn't have disabled those stupid backups."
</p>

<p>
  These settings move all backup files to a central location.
  <em>Bam!</em> No longer annoying.
</p>

<p>
  As an added bonus, that last line makes sure your files are backed
  up even when the files are in version control. Do it.
