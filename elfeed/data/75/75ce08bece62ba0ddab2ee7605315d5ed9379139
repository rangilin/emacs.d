<p>I put all my passwords in a GPG encrypted org-mode file called
keyring.gpg. In a pinch, I don't want to wait for emacs to start in
order to read the file. So I have created a one line script called
view-keyring.sh to open the file in Vim.</p>

<pre class="example">
gpg -d ~/dyn/keyring.gpg | vi -
</pre>
