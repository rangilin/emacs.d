<p>This weekend, ThoughtWorks is hold a recruiting event in New York
City. The idea is to compress the whole recruiting cycle down to a
single weekend. The coding problem will be on Saturday, and those that
pass that hurdle will be invited back for interviews on Sunday. The
idea is that we’ll get job offers to any successful candidates by
Sunday evening. I’ll be there for the first couple of hours on
Saturday.</p>
