<p>I found it difficult to get Alsa to work on Debian. The problem
was that the OSS modules were loaded at boot time. The fix is to
tell the hotplug system to ignore OSS modules.</p>

<pre class="example">
apt-get install alsa-base alsa-oss
cat /usr/share/doc/alsa-base/alsa-base.discover &gt;&gt; /etc/discover.conf
</pre>

<p>Reboot your system and check that the OSS modules are not loaded. Run
<code>alsamixer</code> to check that Alsa is running.</p>
