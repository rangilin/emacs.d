<p>Early last year, <a href="http://chadfowler.com/2011/03/17/leaving-a-legacy-system">I posted</a> about how we&#8217;ve unfortunately turned the word &#8220;legacy&#8221; into a bad word in the software industry.</p>
<p>At Nordic Ruby and again at Aloha Ruby Conf this year I <a href="http://confreaks.com/videos/1240-aloharuby2012-legacy">turned this idea into an exploratory presentation</a>.  I think it turned out pretty well and is an important topic.  Watch it and let me know what you think!</p>
