<p>I got since today this warning when I built the latest emacs. My
workaround is quite simple. I just allocate double the size defined in
puresize.h when running configure.</p>

<pre class="example">
CFLAGS=DSYSTEM_PURESIZE_EXTRA=1000000 ./configure
</pre>

<p>I think I will never see the warning again.</p>
