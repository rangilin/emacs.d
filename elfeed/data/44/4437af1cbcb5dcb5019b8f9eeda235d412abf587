<p>My original plan was to put out one chapter of the companion book I&#8217;m writing for this series along with each screencast but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s realistic anymore. Firstly, they don&#8217;t map very well. A chapter covering a 10 minute screencast will be too small to be a respectable chapter. Multiple screencasts might be the subject of a single chapter. Secondly, it&#8217;s a lot more effort writing chapters than making screencasts (which is not as easy as I was led to believe either).</p>

<p>Either way, I won&#8217;t be putting up book chapters along with each screencast. It&#8217;ll mess up my schedule and I won&#8217;t be able to deliver. I&#8217;ll try to keep one screencast coming every week and when I feel that a logical point has been reached, I&#8217;ll take a week off, write up a chapter and put it out.</p>

<p>As always, if you have any feedback, please email me at <a href="mailto:noufal@emacsmovies.org">noufal@emacsmovies.org</a> or tweet to @emacsmovies.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
