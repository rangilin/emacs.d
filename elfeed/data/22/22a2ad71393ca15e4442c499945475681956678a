<p>Everyone is talking about twitter. Today I was messing with it on my
Android device. Naturally I looked at the #emacs hashtag. I was
annoyed I could not subscribe to it. There were not many tweet and
they were mostly uninteresting.</p>

<p>I looked up @sachac and saw that she was chatting with @ergoemacs. I
could not find a way to follow their discussion.</p>

<p>I have the same feeling I had in 1995 when my colleague Matt at
Microsoft told me about the Web. I was not getting it. He was telling
me he could order pizza online. I told him I could just pick up a
phone and do that. I could also download files from my BBS, what was
the point of it?</p>

<p>It took me some months to appreciate the Web. I have created a Twitter
account five years ago and I still fail to find it interesting. What
am I missing? Send me a tweet! ;)</p>
