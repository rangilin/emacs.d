<p>I migrated from 10.10 to 13.10. I usually turn off my computer by
typing <code>sudo halt</code> in xterm.</p>

<p>With the new version of Ubuntu my computer will halt but not power
off. Taking a look at the man page there is a command called <code>poweroff</code>
that does the job. I find it awkward to type as my old habits die
hard. A better alternative for me is to pass the argument <code>-p</code> to the
<code>halt</code> command.</p>

<p>So I now type <code>sudo halt -p</code> to turn off my computer.</p>
