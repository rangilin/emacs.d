Frabjous day - I have a new laptop. I'd been waiting for ages for the
next model of MacBook Air to be released, so I pounced at the
weekend. And I think that makes it time for the geekblogger's
favourite: the "OSX Apps I Install First" list. I'll avoid the obvious
ones like Chrome, Spotify, Dropbox &amp; XCode, and skip straight to the
meat. Hopefully there's something here you haven't heard of before
that you can try&#x2026;

<p>
Do you like Terminal, Spotlight or Chrome's universal search feature?
Then Alfred is for you. It's a fast app-launcher, file-finder &amp;
web-searcher that's absolutely the first thing I put on every
Mac. More flexible than Spotlight, faster than QSB and currently
thriving (unlike the almost-zombie Quicksilver), I can't recommend it
enough.

<p>
We were burgled last year. My laptop - my working life - was taken. I
had Time Machine backups, and I got lucky (they didn't steal my
external hard drive) so I got it all back. But never again will I risk
my music &amp; my photos<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> on the laziness of thieves.
</p>

<p>
In the weeks following the burglary I tried several off-site backup
solutions<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. BackBlaze is the bee's knees. It's written by ex-Apple
employees, and it shows. Actually, it hides. It just sits quietly in
the background ensuring that my data's always backed up to a second
country. It also does second duty as a poor man's version control
system, and third duty as a find-if-stolen service. But it's
absolutely, 100% worth the price of a latte a month. Get it.

I'm not a graphic designer. I'll never be a graphic designer. So I
can't tell you exactly how Pixelmator compares to Photoshop. I can
tell you that it does more than everything I need, it's about 95%
cheaper than Photoshop, and it's one of the most polished pieces of
software I've ever used.

<p>
My 'hobby' iPad app, <a href="http://itunes.jenkster.com/time-for-tea">Time for Tea</a>, was
designed in Pixelmator and I think the result is pretty good (for a
non-graphic designer):

(That's the current peak of my design skills. Any shortcomings are mine, not Pixelmator's.)

Mozy sucks, by the way.
