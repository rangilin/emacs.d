<p>Our keynote at QCon London 2012 looks at the role data is playing in
our lives (and that it’s doing more than just getting bigger).</p>

<ul>
  <li>How the world of data is changing: its
growing, becoming more distributed and connected. </li>
  <li>The industry’s response: the rise of NoSQL, the shift to service
integration, the appearance of event sourcing, the impact of clouds
and new analytics with a greater role for visualization. </li>
  <li>How data is being used now, with a particular emphasis from Rebecca on
data in the developing world. </li>
  <li>What does all this
mean to our personal responsibilities as software professionals.</li>
</ul>
