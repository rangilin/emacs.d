One of these was an email exchange I had with my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/badrij">Badri Janakiraman</a>, who is a long-time ThoughtWorker with a lot of experience in Rails and other development stacks. We decided to video this conversation, as I thought some other people would enjoy it too. Our conversation looks at the Hexagonal Rails approach, what it is, and when itâ€™s appropriate. <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/badri-hexagonal">This first video</a> introduces the notion of Hexagonal Architecture, and talks about how it effects the relationship with the database - which ends up being a choice between the Active Record and Data Mapper patterns.</p>
