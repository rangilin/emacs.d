<p>Things are not getting better today... My domain name has been added
to <a href="http://www.spamcop.net/">Spamcop</a>. This means that most of my e-mail bounces back to me. Just
great! I have talked with my <a href="http://westhost.com/">web hosting</a> company and we are trying to
resolve the problem ASAP.</p>

<p>And I have to reinstall Windows XP, endless fun :(</p>

<p>Good session with my client, did tricky GRUB manipulation and
partition swapping and it all ended well.</p>

<p>I have discovered why <code>gnomemeeting</code> crashed when answering a call. Why
the edit field in <code>Mozilla</code> would not work the second time I ran it. It
turns out that I had the accessibility feature turned on by Gnome. I
don't know if this will impact other user of Debian out there but my
advice is to turn it off. I find it quite funny that it completely
crippled my environment. But only in hindsight, I have been gnashing
my teeth for days on this.</p>
