<p>It's a good idea to backup your system. I haven't done it out of sheer
laziness. As they say in France &quot;Les cordonniers sont les plus mal
lac√©es&quot;.</p>

<p>I don't want to save big directories containing temporary files or
external drives that are mounted.</p>

<pre class="example">
find / -xdev -depth -regex '/\git\|backup\)' -prune -o -print0 | cpio -o0v | gzip &gt; backup.cpio.gz
</pre>

<p>The -xdev flag of find restricts other partition mounted on the
directory you are giving. Next the regex will prune directory
called git or backup. The v flag of cpio will list each files being
backed up.</p>

<p>And here is the command to restore your system:</p>

<pre class="example">
gunzip -c backup.cpio.gz | cpio -i
</pre>
