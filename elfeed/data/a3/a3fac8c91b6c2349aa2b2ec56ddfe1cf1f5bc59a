<p>The Mac has a built in VNC server for screen sharing. Unfortunately
since Lion it's broken for all client except the one distributed by
Apple.</p>

<p>I fixed this by installing Vine Server version 4.0 available here:</p>

<p>To have it start when your server boots you just need to go to User &amp;
Group in the System Preference. Click on the Login Items tab and drag
the VNC server icon there. Obviously you will need to set autologin
otherwise it won't work.</p>
