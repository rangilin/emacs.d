<p>I have just noticed that I have been using Linux for 10
years. This was was my first post on the subject. I didn't yet
know that Xfree86 wasn't Linux.</p>

My mouse is a PS/2 type of mouse. Any idea would be greatly appreciated.

<p>It is ironical that I heard about Linux while I was working at
Microsoft. My co-worker Frank told it was cool and I should check it
out. He was also know as &quot;leper&quot; in some circle. He sent me a spoof
e-mail from <code>god@pearly.gate</code> that baffled me.</p>

<p>Frank hung around with his goth friend Matt. I remember when Matt
told me about the web and I was just no getting it. I wonder what
Frank and Matt are up to now.</p>
