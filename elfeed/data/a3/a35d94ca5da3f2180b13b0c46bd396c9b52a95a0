<h2>Extending Emacs with Elisp</h2>
<p>If you've followed the previous tutorials, you're familiar with
loading configuration, and you now have a system that can download
packages for you from the various Emacs package repositories. Now
let's dive into where Emacs get's really fun: extending Emacs
yourself.</p>
<p>One of the things I love about modern programming is the idea of
feedback as quickly as possible: it's great to see the result of the
changes of your code instantly. So let's try writing a generic way to
do this. We'll write a function that adds a hook to an Emacs buffer,
so when it saves, a shell command will run. (e.g. 'python myscript.py' for a
python script, or running unit tests, etc)</p>
<p>Create a file called my-methods.el, adding it to your .emacs.d/
directory. To write our command, we'll need to do the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a hash to store (buffer, command) pairs to run</li>
<li>create a method to add a (buffer, command) pair to our hash</li>
<li>look in our hash if a buffer is saved, and run the command if the buffer exists in the hash</li>
<li>remove entries from our hash if the buffer is killed</li>
</ul>
<p>So let's start by adding our hash:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>; my-methods.el
(setq my-command-buffer-hooks (make-hash-table))
</pre></div>
<p>(setq &lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt;) will set a variable &lt;name&gt; to a value
&lt;value&gt;. This is one way of instantiating a variable in elisp. There
are other ways, such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Defining-Variables.html">defvar</a>,
but I chose setq because we are simply defining an internal variable
for usage. Other variations which define variables typically provide
some other purpose, such as a user-customizable value or a constant.</p>
<p>Now that we have our hash table, let's start adding to it! We'll write
our first function to my-methods.el:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>; my-methods.el

(defun my-command-on-save-buffer (c)
    &quot;Run a command &lt;c&gt; every time the buffer is saved &quot;
    (interactive &quot;sShell command: &quot;)
    (puthash (buffer-file-name) c my-command-buffer-hooks))
</pre></div>
<p>This method takes in a variable 'c', takes the current buffer, and
adds pair of (buffer-name, command-as-a-string) to our hash. This is a
short function, but it's a dense amount of functionality, so it's
worth explaining a bit further.</p>
<div class="section" id="defun">
<h3>defun</h3>
<p>Defun is the standard way to define a function. It uses the following syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>(defun &lt;method_name&gt; (&lt;var_a&gt; &lt;var_b&gt;...)
  &lt;docstring&gt;
  &lt;interactive?&gt;
  &lt;method_body&gt;)
</pre></div>
<p>Here's a description of each:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&lt;method_name&gt;: a symbol to populate with the method</li>
<li>&lt;var_a&gt; &lt;var_b&gt;... : a list of symbols to populate with passed parameters</li>
<li>&lt;docstring&gt;: a string explaining what your method does</li>
<li>&lt;interactive?&gt;: options. we'll take about this more in a second</li>
<li>&lt;method_body&gt;: a lisp expression which has access to &lt;var_a&gt; &lt;var_b&gt;... symbols described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>So pretty standard for a method definition in any language, except for (interactive?).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interactive">
<h3>interactive</h3>
<p>So what is interactive? Well, it's an optional expression, which, if
passed in to defun, makes the method 'interactive'. Interactive
basically means it's one of the command that can be run by 'M-x': it
becomes a publicly exposed command that an Emacs user should be able
to run.</p>
<p>(interactive) by itself results in a command that does not ask the
user for input. In other words, it's only useful for commands that
have no variables.</p>
<p>If we want the user to be able to type some input, we need to add in a
string into interactive, like our example above:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(interactive &quot;sShell Command:&quot;)
</pre>
<p>So this will take in a single string. So how do we know it always
takes a string and only a string? Well, it's the first 's' in the
&quot;sShell Command&quot;. The first character is called an 'interactive code':
it's a way to express what the expected input is. Specifying the
proper interactive code is important: codes such as 'D' (directory
name) or 'C' (emacs command) can provide auto-completion, making your
function all the more useful.</p>
<p>Multiple arguments can be passed by delimiting with newlines:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(interactive &quot;sA String:\nDA Directory&quot;)
</pre>
<p>A full list of interactive codes can be found here: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Interactive-Codes.html#Interactive-Codes">interactive codes</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="puthash-gethash-remhash">
<h3>puthash/gethash/remhash</h3>
<p>So the one thing that might be a little strange if you work in a
primarily OOP environment: (puthash &lt;map&gt; &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;) instead of
something like &lt;map&gt;.put(&lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;).</p>
<p>elisp is a functional language, which means that everything is,
essentially, a function or data. There is no real concept of
object-oriented programming: if you want to modify an object, you call
a method with the object as the argument, not an object calling a method.</p>
<p>To work with a hash, elisp provides puthash/gethash/remhash. You can
read more here: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Hash-Access.html#Hash-Access">hash-access</a></p>
<p>So at this point, you should have all the info you need to understand
the my-command-on-save-buffer option.</p>
<p>Now let's add a couple more functions to complete our hook.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="my-command-on-buffer-run-hook">
<h3>my-command-on-buffer-run-hook</h3>
<p>Add the following to you my-methods.el:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>; .emacs.d/my-methods.el

(defun my-command-buffer-kill-hook ()
  &quot;Remove a key from &lt;command-buffer-hooks&gt; if it exists&quot;
  (remhash (buffer-file-name) my-command-buffer-hooks))
</pre></div>
<p>This function removes the current buffer from the hooks hash. Pretty
straightforward with what we know now.</p>
<p>And this one:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>; .emacs.d/my-methods.el

(defun my-command-buffer-run-hook ()
  &quot;Run a command if it exists in the hook&quot;
  (let ((hook (gethash (buffer-file-name) my-command-buffer-hooks)))
    (when hook
        (shell-command hook))))
</pre></div>
<p>This is the actual function that runs the hook. Note the extra check wrappend in a with.
(when is a shorthand for if with only one argument. It's more
lisp-esque to provide shorthands like this).</p>
<p>Finally we need to add the hooks so that these function actually run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>; .emacs.d/my-methods.el

;; add hooks
(add-hook &#39;kill-buffer-hook &#39;my-command-buffer-kill-hook)
(add-hook &#39;after-save-hook &#39;my-command-buffer-run-hook)
</pre></div>
<p>Emacs provides a nice hook implementation. pass in the hook name you
want to listen to, and the function name you want to call.</p>
<p>And that's it! give it a shot. In fact, let's try it our Emacs
now. open up my-methods.el and type: M-x eval-buffer. Voila! you know
have your my-command-on-save-buffer. Emacs has the ability to evaluate
code with it's lisp interpreter, which allows modifying the global
state of the editor itself. By evaluating our code, we basically just
added the functions we writing to the actual emacs instance we've been working in!</p>
<p>Now this is what I'm saying when I love modern programming. Getting
automated feedback faster is always better, and Emacs is great at
providing fast feedback on editor changes. You don't even have to
restart your process! You can modify the environment you're working
in, as you're working on it, and see the changes instantly!</p>
<p>Anyway, let's try our new functions with a test file.</p>
<p>Open a file /tmp/tmp.txt, save it (C-x C-s), and run: M-x
my-command-on-buffer-save. It'll ask you far a shell argument.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://toumorokoshi.github.io/images/emacs-from-scratch-part-3-myhook.png" />
<p>Type in the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;hello world&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now type something and save your file. boom! The output should be in
the mini-buffer (you can see the full output in the *Shell Command Output* buffer).</p>
<img alt="" src="http://toumorokoshi.github.io/images/emacs-from-scratch-part-3-echo.png" />
<p>Congrats! You've just written your first functional elisp function. And it's pretty useful too.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about developing elisp code, you can't go
wrong with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/index.html#Top">elisp manual</a>.
Like most languages, some things are not going to be the most
intuitive in the beginning. However, as you become more comfortable
elisp will start to feel like just another amazing feature of Emacs.</p>
<p>The other way to learn a lot is by looking at other people's emacs
packages and files. Go to <a class="reference external" href="http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/">melpa</a>, find
a package you like, and click the 'source' link, and start reading!</p>
