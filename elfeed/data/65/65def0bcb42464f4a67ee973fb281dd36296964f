<p><a href="jumpc.el">jumpc.el</a> implements the jump cursor feature found in vim.</p>

<p>A jump is added every time you insert a character on a different
line.</p>

<p>Jumps are remembered in a jump list. With the C-o and C-i
command you can go to cursor positions before older jumps, and back
again. Thus you can move up and down the list.</p>

<p>Jumps are read and saved in the same configuration file as vim so
you can switch back and forth between the two editors</p>

<p>It part of GNU ELPA so it's very easy to install.</p>
