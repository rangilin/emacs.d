<p>One of my friend writes in Japanese on FaceBook. I look up Japanese
words with Emacs. Sacha Chua mentioned that using the mobile version of
Facebook works well. She suggested to turn on cookies, but I found it
didn't remember my password next time I ran Emacs.</p>

<p>So I whipped up <a href="ivan-w3m.el">some code</a> to do auto login. This is my w3m
customization file so you will probably need to edit a bit before it
works for you. The variables ivan-w3m-facebook-user
ivan-w3m-facebook-password need to be set. Run M-x fb to launch it.</p>

<p>If there is sufficient interest I might write something more generic
along the line of a Firefox's password manager.</p>
