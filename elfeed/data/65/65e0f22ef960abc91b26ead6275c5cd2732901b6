<p>I’m publishing this as a “rough cut”, so I apologise to everyone annoyed by having to <a href="http://link.jbrains.ca/1we6jPq">download a PDF</a> to read this article. I have my reasons. Some of the links in the document don’t work; the links to external web sites, however, should. A handful of people have already suggested improvements and reported problems, which I appreciate, particularly the cordial and civil manner in which they’ve done it. (Hint.)</p>

<p>For those of you on a big-enough screen, perhaps this embedded viewer will work better:</p>
