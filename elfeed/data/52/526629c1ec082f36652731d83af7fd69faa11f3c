<p>Next month I’ll be travelling to South Africa again for the first time in over ten years. I’m going down to give a keynote at the <a href="http://agileafrica.jcse.org.za">Agile Africa conference</a> in Johannesburg on August 12/13. I’ll also be popping down to Cape Town on Thursday 15th (details and links to follow when I have them). </p>
