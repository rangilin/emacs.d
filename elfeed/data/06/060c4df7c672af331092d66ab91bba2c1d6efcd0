What a great title, eh? Clojure's a fantastic language for writing
DSLs, and yet it's a hard topic get into. A good book on the subject
is just what the Clojure ecosystem needs.
</p>

<p>
Sadly, this isn't that book.
</p>

<p>
The biggest problem is that there's hardly any content about writing
DSLs. This is a ~240 page book, and about 200 of that is just "Intro
to Clojure" stuff. That would be fine, but there are much better
introductory books out there.
</p>

<p>
Filler aside, that leaves maybe 40 pages that are actually about writing
DSLs. Sadly it's the weakest stuff in the book. It consists of two
examples of using Clojure to wrap existing Java libraries. One's a
Twitter client, the other's a wrapper around Java's Date &amp; Calendar
classes. And there's no way around saying this - both are badly written.
</p>

<p>
It would be a terrible shame if any beginner in Clojure read this
stuff and thought it was a good way to proceed.  What should be a
simple function to read a config file into a map is presented in an
overwrought &amp; brittle fashion.  Macros are used frequently but never
appropriately.  Clojure code drops down into Java interop for no good
reason at all.  And the author seems to have an obsession with
dynamically-binding variables, regardless of whether it's appropriate.
I strongly suspect this betrays a lack of understanding about what
they're for. Either way, the Twitter DSL is going to break as soon as
you do anything interesting with it, like delay the results. (Stuart
Sierra has <a href="http://stuartsierra.com/2013/03/29/perils-of-dynamic-scope">a great post about it</a>.)
</p>

<p>
So is there anything here to like? Yes, the author is quite lucid. His
technical writing reads easily. I hope he writes a book on another
topic one day - but he'll need to be far better versed in the
material.

In the meantime, if you want an intro to Clojure book, check out the

looking for a good book on DSL writing&#x2026;well&#x2026;so am I. In the
meantime, <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2011-07/growing-a-dsl-with-clojure">here's a good article</a> on one application of the technique&#x2026;
