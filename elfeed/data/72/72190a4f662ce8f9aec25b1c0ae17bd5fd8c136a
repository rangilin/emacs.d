<p>Quick tip on how to burn CD with Linux kernel 2.6 and Debian
testing. Edit the file <code>/etc/default/cdrecord</code>. Add
the following two lines:</p>

<pre class="example">
CDR_DEVICE=cdrw
cdrw=/dev/hdb 8 4m burnfree
</pre>

<p>Replace <code>/dev/hdb</code> with you CD-ROM device of course! That's all there's
is too it. 8is for the speed you want to write, and the <code>4m</code> is the size
of your CD writer buffer. The program cdrecordshould work like a
charm.</p>

<p>Well since Gnome 2.6 just got in testing I have downloaded the
whole darn thing. I had a quick look at <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/">epiphany</a>. The
new official Gnome browser. It looks fine, too bad it didn't import
my Mozilla's bookmark :(</p>
