<p>I maintain several quote files. Each quote is separated by %. The
author line starts with &quot; &mdash;&quot;. This line at the top is how I tell
to wrap quotes without messing everything.</p>

<pre class="example">
-*- mode: text; paragraph-separate: &quot;%\\|    --&quot;; -*-
</pre>

<p>The text is a simple regular expression. I guess it can be useful for
other formats.</p>
