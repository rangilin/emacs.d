The year is half over, and we&#8217;re still hiring like crazy. Â This year we&#8217;ve added 22 associates, which means our employee count has increased by 23.4% in the past six months. Yay math! Raise a glass to these fine folks, and join me in congratulating them on their new awesome jobs. &#160; Matt Charette, Sales [&#8230;]
