<p>I enjoyed the Churchill Club panel discussion on wikileaks on
Wednesday. It’s thoughtful and well worth watching <a href="http://fora.tv/2011/01/19/WikiLeaks_Why_It_Matters_Why_It_Doesnt">the video</a>.</p>

<p>I particularly appreciated Daniel Ellsberg’s picture of the climate of
government secrecy and Roy’s call to follow the example of librarians
resisting secret gag orders. (There was a bit were it threatens to sink
deep into the nature of libertarianism, but fortunately that didn’t
last long.) While my thoughts on wikileaks are
complicated (and I’ve not had the energy to write about them) I think
the incident raises some very serious issues around the contending
forces of privacy and openness. This panel provides a useful briefing
on some of these perspectives.</p>
