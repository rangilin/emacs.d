so I’m always happy to appear on it. I’m extra-pleased this time,
because it gives me the chance to highlight some valuable software development
techniques that I feel are particularly under-used. </p>

<p>When we first started using agile methods at the beginning of this
century, one of our biggest questions was how to handle database
design in an agile way. Fortunately we had Pramod Sadalage around, a
DBA who was determined to find a way to incorporate databases with the
agile working style. He developed a set of techniques, including
regular database refactoring and scripted migrations that are
version-controlled with application code. These techniques have now
becomes habitual for ThoughtWorks but have not been as widely adopted in
the industry as I believe they should. This podcast provides an hour
or so that outlines how this all works, which I’m hoping will encourage
greater usage of them.</p>
