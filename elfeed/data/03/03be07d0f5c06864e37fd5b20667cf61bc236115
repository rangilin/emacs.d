<p>Life is a lot like snowboarding. It&rsquo;s about leaning forward and keeping your eye on where you&rsquo;re going. Relax, go with the flow and enjoy yourself. Every so often you might catch an edge, but you get up and keep going.</p>

<p>Once you get to the bottom, your bones may ache and your legs may be sore, but it&rsquo;s the kind of pain that means something. Because, in the end, you have conquered the mountain.</p>
