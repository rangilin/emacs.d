<p>What's wrong with the latest version of Thunderbird? It doesn't work
with my server that uses STARTTLS. I generated a log file.</p>

<p>Well crap it should work. It did work on my father's Thunderbird a
year ago . How annoying. So I told my client to use Pegasus Mail which
doesn't look as pretty but it works.</p>
