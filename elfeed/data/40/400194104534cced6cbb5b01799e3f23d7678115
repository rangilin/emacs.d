A fast thought on writing accounting software: The most common mistake
programmers make when writing an accounting system is they think it's
all about balances. They think the point of an accounting system is to
tell you your account balance, so they design the data model around
that.

They're wrong. The point of an accounting system is to track the
complete history of the movements of money and other assets. Auditing
isn't just a feature of the system, <i>it is the system</i>. Balances are
just a summary report on the <i>real</i> data.
