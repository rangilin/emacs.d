Wow! I just found out I've been elected as Chairman Of The Olympic
Committee For Getting People Who Don't Give A Stuff About The Olympics
To Give A Stuff About The Olympics.
</p>

<p>
My first campaign will be, "Come To London in 2012: The Aquarium Will
Still Be Ace."
</p>

<p>
I'll follow up with my second campaign, "Enjoyed The Aquarium? You
Could Watch Some Humans Swim Next, I Suppose."
