<p>My apologies for the quiet month, as Iâ€™ve plans weighing on my mind. In the past I have asked for another Emacs Lisp developer to hopefully step up and offer to maintain <a href="https://github.com/ejmr/php-mode">PHP Mode</a>. <em>As of today I will no longer work on feature requests for the project.</em> If developers continue to send me improvements and/or bug fixes then I will be happy to review and merge them as necessary. However, I feel like it is time to end my personal work on PHP Mode. I will <em>not</em> completely walk away and leave the project in a dead state until someone is willing to take over the role as maintainer. But from today forward I will no longer be an active contributor, instead simply merging contributions from the myriad of developers who have worked to improve PHP Mode to what it is today.</p>
<p>If you are a PHP programmer, use Emacs, and wish to improve the mode then please take a loot at the latest mode.  If you have any questions feel free to ask any quenions.</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/ericjmritz.wordpress.com/514/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/ericjmritz.wordpress.com/514/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=ericjmritz.name&amp;blog=46833520&amp;post=514&amp;subd=ericjmritz&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />
