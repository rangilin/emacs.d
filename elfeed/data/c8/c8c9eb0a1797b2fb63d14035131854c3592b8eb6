<p>Here are three emacs packages that got my interest lately.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">elfeed</a> is a fine RSS reader. Since the demise of Google news reader I
went back to newsticker. I have never been very happy with it. I am
glad elfeed does a much better job. I run it on a second emacs
because the HTTP fetching slows everything down.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/lispy">lispy</a> is a new kid on the block. It's inspired on paredit but works on
single key stroke. I reported it broke edebug and Oleh Krehel fixed it
the next day. I have disabled the insertion of matching parenthesis
and quotes as it drives me crazy.</p>

<p>Finally a minor mode for dired called <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiredDetails">dired-details.el</a>. It hides all
that superfluous stuff displayed left of the file name in dired. A
keystroke ')' will show the details again. It's very nice in
directories with long file name.</p>
