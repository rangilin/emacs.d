<p>This episode describes buffers and how to use them.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry about the gap but my real life got a little hectic and I had to take a couple of weeks off.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also changed the video bitrate for the mkv file to something much lesser. I can&#8217;t see a video quality degradation but the file size is much smaller now. Do let me know if you experience any problems.</p>
