To help understand and explain what all this is about I’ve teamed up with my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/boicy">James Lewis</a>, who has been an active pioneer in this style. We’re working on writing various materials about microservices and have <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">published the first installment of an article</a> that explores the common characteristics we see in microservice architectures and what role they can play in software systems. With this installment we talk about how microservices think about componentization. We’ll release further installments to explore more characteristics over the next couple of weeks.</p>
