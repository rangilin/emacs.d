<a href="http://www.meetup.com/West-London-Hack-Night/events/120495682/">Last Thursday's</a> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/West-London-Hack-Night/">West London Hack Night</a> was great fun. The chosen topic
was Genetic Algorithms. More specifically, given a pool of random
strings, can you use GA to get them to evolve towards a target?
</p>

<p>
It's a simple application of a sophisticated idea, but perhaps a
perfect way to get started as you actually can code it up in about an
hour and a half.

<p>
There were four teams hacking in four different languages, and here's
their code:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/krisajenkins/javascriptgeneticalgorithm">JavaScript</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oppianmatt/westlondonhack_20130711">Python</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/t-ob/genetic">Clojure</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/CaffeinatedDave/GeneticAlgorithms">Scala</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Great fun, as usual. I'm already looking forward to the next.
