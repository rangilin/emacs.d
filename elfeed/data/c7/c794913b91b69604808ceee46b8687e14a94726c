<p>I’ve often come across a pattern in code where you organize some computation by passing collections through a pipeline of operations. I first came across it in Unix, did it in Smalltalk and Ruby, and find it common in functional programming. I’ve written <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/collection-pipeline">an article</a> to describe this pattern, and this is the first installment which contains an initial introduction and a definition of the pattern.</p>
