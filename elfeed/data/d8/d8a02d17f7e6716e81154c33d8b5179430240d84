<div><p>I tweeted &quot;High throughput is the best low latency&quot; and got some good feedback that this wasn&#039;t universally true, so I thought I would take this chance to explain what I meant and see if others can chime in on when this relationship doesn&#039;t hold.</p><p><br /></p><p>I was thinking specifically of software development, where it is typical for teams to have months or even years of backlog. Customers know that if they submit a new feature they aren&#039;t going to see it for a long time unless they do something special. Teams come up with elaborate priority/urgency/importance/value continua to supplement favor-trading and outright bribery as ways to do the most important stuff first.</p><p><br /></p><p>Say a team starts improving its throughput by eliminating the root causes of problems, investing in infrastructure, and more closely coordinating their efforts. It will sometimes start burning down the backlog. Sometimes it will even eliminate the backlog entirely, resulting in customers receiving new features in a week (or whatever the basic cycle time in). Latency has been reduced from months to weeks by improving throughput, not by addressing latency directly.</p><p><br /></p><p>This style of improvement is a win/win: the team is getting more done and the customers are getting features faster. Some commentators have generalized to say that throughput is the only way, or only legitimate way, to reduce latency. I disagree. Coming to Facebook was a wakeup call for me in all the ways that latency can be further reduced, even for a team that already has good throughput. Whether to sacrifice throughput to improve latency is a complicated and interesting question, balancing the expected lifetime of the changes, the frequency and magnitude of throughput reduction, and the opportunity cost of the latency saved.</p><p><br /></p><p>My point is that &quot;cutting corners&quot; to improve latency is not my first strategy. First I try to improve throughput as much as possible. If the resulting latency is sufficient, I can stop. If there is value to further reducing latency, then I move into tradeoff land and make harder choices.</p><p><br /></p><p>What are cases where throughput is driven higher by reducing latency?</p></div>
