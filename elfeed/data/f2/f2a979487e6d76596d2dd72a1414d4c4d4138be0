<p>Today I forgot my root password, it must be Alzheimer. Anyhow here is
the quick recipe to reset it. On the grub boot screen type 'e' for
edit. Next edit the line starting with linux, at the end add
init=/bin/bash it should look like this.</p>

<pre class="example">
linux /boot/vmlinuz-version root=UUID=hex ro quite init=/bin/bash
</pre>

<p>Next hit Ctrl-X to boot, you should land on a prompt without having to
type your password. Next enter the following two commands:</p>

<pre class="example">
mount -o remount,rw /
passwd
</pre>

<p>Enter the new password twice, type the following:</p>

<pre class="example">
sync
reboot
</pre>

<p>You should be all set!</p>
