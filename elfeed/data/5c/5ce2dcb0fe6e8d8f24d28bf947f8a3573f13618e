In a surprise move, Microsoft have today announced that they're
getting out of the browser game. "It's time to call it a day," said a
Microsoft spokesperson. "We've been working on Internet Explorer for
over fifteen years now, and <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2988-i-thought-internet-explorer-9-was-supposed">we still can't render basic layouts
reliably</a>."
</p>

<p>
"'Does it work in IE yet?' has become a stock question for web
developers around the globe, and it's getting embarrassing."
</p>

<p>
"It's time we left the browser game to the professionals, and focussed
on what we're good at: rearranging the menu bar in Word every 6
months."
