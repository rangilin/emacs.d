<p>This happens when the snapshot was created on a bigger partition that
your are trying to restore to. Here's how to get around this problem.
Mount the dmg image by double clicking on it.</p>

<p>Next open the terminal and run the following two commands:</p>

<pre class="example">
cp -a /Volumes/path-to-dmg/ /Volumes/partition
bless /Volumes/partition
</pre>

<p>The trailing slash is important in the cp source. It prevents copying
the folder path-to-dmg inside /Volume/partition. During the copy I saw
some error about socket file not being copied. It didn't seem to
matter.</p>
