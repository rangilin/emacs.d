Later this month they are running <a href="http://gotocon.com/amsterdam-2013/">a full conference in Amsterdam</a>, and I’ll be doing a keynote for them on Wednesday June 19. I’ll be doing my usual <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html">suite of talks</a> format, but haven’t yet decided which talks will go in the set. I hope to see some of my regular readers there.</p>
