<p>
Here at CueCorp Ltd. we have a total approach to software Quality,
experimenting with every possible angle to maximize shareholder value.
</p>

<p>
Our <b>Quality Insurance</b> department collects a regular monthly premium
from our developers. In the event that bad code gets released to
production, the devs put in a claim and get sent a cheque to cover the
cost of fixing it. Premiums are climbing, but we have high hopes for
this innovative, market-driven approach to Quality.
</p>

<p>
Our <b>Quality Assurance</b> department wanders around the office daily,
talking to devs, managers and all other staff, confidently assuring
them that the software will work. We're not 100% sure of the value of
this, but we checked the dictionary and it confidently assured us that
that's what 'assurance' means.
</p>

<p>
Our <b>Quality Ensurance</b> department is our most successful arm. Though
their remit is wide, they take every angle and every opportunity to
ensure the quality of our software. By writing test suites,
by training our devs, by explaining the value of refactoring to our
management team, by working with our architects to choose simpler and
more reliable tools - there is no approach they won't try to ensure
that they ensure what they're supposed to ensure.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, Quality is our highest priority, and our structure is an
ongoing experiment. If you care more about software Quality than
labels, rest assured (ensured? insured?) there's a place for you here
at CueCorp!
