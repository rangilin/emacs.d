An interesting question at the moment is, should I build native iOS &amp;
Android apps, or build one webapp to rule them all? There are pros and
cons to each. Most of the arguments are obvious and well-trodden, but
here's one point that's important and not being said: Google.
</p>

<p>
Google have put their stake in the ground and are investing heavily in
the webapp route. Their Gmail &amp; Google+ clients are are easily the
most advanced mobile webapps in the game. And do you know what?
They're still a bit rubbish. They're a bit slow. They're a bit
flakey. They all have the, "This looked really good in the lab", feel
to them.
</p>

<p>
Google's webapps are "impressive, for a webapp", which is like saying,
"he's cool, for a geek". A qualified compliment isn't much of a
compliment at all. I really want them to succeed, and they're doing an
amazing job, but for all their effort I still go to the app store to
find the <b>real</b> app.
</p>

<p>
If Google, with all their talent and resources, can push the
possibilities of webapps and we still need to offer excuses, maybe
that says it's not the way to go&#x2026;
