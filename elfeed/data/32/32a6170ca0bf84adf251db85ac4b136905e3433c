by Robert Daigneau and it’s called Service Design Patterns. It’s a topic
that’s already had too many books on it, but I added this one to the
series because I think Robert has done a particularly good job of
collecting together the best advice on the topic and organizing it into
a useful handbook.  This is the book that I think ought to become the
standard book on the topic.</p>
