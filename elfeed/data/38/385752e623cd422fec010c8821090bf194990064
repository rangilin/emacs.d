<p>We're stoked to announce that Go Newsletter is teaming up with <a href="http://www.gopheracademy.com/">Gopher Academy</a>.</p>
<p>Over the last year we've been hugely impressed by the work of Brian Ketelsen, Erik St Martin and Dave Cheney strengthening the Go community across the globe. Two specific achievements that stand out are the excellent <a href="http://blog.gopheracademy.com/">Gopher Academy blog</a> and upcoming (sold out!) <a href="http://www.gophercon.com/">GopherCon</a>, but there are many more.</p>
<p>Joining up with Gopher Academy means we can concentrate our efforts on improving the newsletter as well as pitching in to help where needed, so we see it as a benefit to everyone.</p>
<p>The administration of Go Newsletter will remain as-is. That means that I (Matt) will remain solely responsible for maintaining the email address list and sending the emails themselves. But we are moving under the umbrella (so to speak) of Gopher Academy, so the rest is an implementation detail.</p>
<p>Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:matt@golangweekly.com">matt@golangweekly.com</a>&nbsp;if you have any questions, and we hope you're as excited as we are to be joining Gopher Academy.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Matt Cottingham and Kelsey Hightower.</p>
