Two weeks ago, I was invited to fly to Sarajevo and run a Google
Bootcamp. We debated about the content for a bit, and settled on a
training &amp; hacking day around <a href="http://www.angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>. A couple of hour-long talks
from me, and as much hacking as possible. Cue frantic writing of
slides.
</p>

<p>
On Friday we flew there via Vienna - not quite believing it was real -
and yesterday they came, they saw &amp; they hacked:

It was a <i>fantastic</i> day. Everyone had great fun &amp; got their brains
filled with new ideas. Me too.
</p>

<p>
I'm still churning over the event in my mind, it's still buzzing my
brain, so I can't really write an elegant post about it yet. But if
you'll indulge, here are a few random memories while they're fresh:
</p>

<p>
The attendees were great. Apparently there's not really a tech scene
in Sarajevo like there is in London. Talks like this are a rare
thing. But everyone was straight in and hacking. There were some
really great ideas being hacked on &amp; everyone was keen to learn. Geeks
of Sarajevo, I salute you.

Doug Crockford - I stole some of your JavaScript jokes. I'm
sorry. JavaScript jokes are hard to write and you cornered the market
early. To make up for it I told people to use JSLint &amp; buy your book.

I met the President! Well, I met a President. The event was held at a
university, and the current Arch-Chancellor is the ex-President of
Bosnia. He gives good handshake.
</p>

<p>
At the start of the day, they clipped a microphone on me and said,
"Say something while we check the levels." Normal people say, "One
two. One two." I recited The Owl &amp; The Pussy Cat. Parenthood has
changed me.
</p>

<p>
One of the local TV stations showed up and interviewed me. That was
weird. On a day like this, hackers come up to you and ask things like,
"How do you conditionally hide DOM elements generated by an ng-repeat
tag?<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>" But TV people ask you questions like, "What do you think
this means for Bosnia?"  Under the circumstances, I think I switched
gear fairly smoothly. :-}

I love doing this kind of thing. It doesn't matter if it's a guitar or
a slideshow clicker in my hand, I like it. There's a feeling that
comes upon you in the hours before the deadline. If you run away from
that feeling it's called stagefright. If you run towards it it's a
complete adrenaline rush. And speaking as a sedentary programmer who
hates sports, it's rare that my body has reason to produce adrenaline.
</p>


<p>
I wrote my own slideshow software. I'd normally scoff at such wheel
re-invention, but I really wanted to be able to show Angular working
live, within the slides, so I wrote an Angular slideshower that ran
Angular code inside my Angular slides<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.  But on the morning of
the event I hit a minor crisis. The room was unexpectedly huge, and
they handed me a wifi clicker. I'd expected to be standing near my
laptop and hadn't written clicker support into the code. To my relief
&amp; amazement, I managed to hack it in in about 5 minutes. Say what you
like about JavaScript, but I couldn't have done that in Java or
Objective-C half as fast.

As if we didn't have enough to worry about, I decided that we'd
organize a couple of extra lightning talks. I figured on a day like
this it's my job to throw as much information into people's heads as I
possibly can. Amer - one of the guys helping me out - and I threw some
ideas onto a whiteboard, and people voted. Less and Hadoop won the
popular vote, so we each improvised 10 minutes of information. The
bonus talks seemed to go down really well. I'm glad we did it.  (For
the record, I did the Less talk. That's easy. You pretty much just
have to say, "Less exists!" and people get it. Less rocks. Less is
easy and it rocks.)  (For the other record, I'd offered to do a Vim
Masterclass. It lost to Less by one vote. Sadface.)

It's rough - I might find some time and polish it up into a
real app - but you can see it here if you like.
