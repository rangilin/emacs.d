<p>C-b is too hard for me to type. I don't use the right control key
because it's too hard to reach. So I use the left key which makes me
leave the home row. I believe it's a waste of time.</p>

<p>Maybe if I had a Kinesis keyboard it would be different but I am not
willing to shell out $$$ for work and home. Beside it wouldn't work
when I am on a laptop.</p>

<p>I had a heretic idea. Why not map C-h for left a bit like vim? I have
done that today for zsh and emacs. I have unmapped the left arrow so I
get into the habit of using it. I will see how it goes.</p>
