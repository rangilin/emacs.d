<a href="http://www.osfashland.org/">Oregon Shakespeare Festival</a> and a nice mix of hikes). So I’m late in
mentioning that <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321826620">NoSQL Distilled is now available for pre-order on
InformIT</a>. Its ship date is August 17. </p>

<p>If you pre-order you can get 35% off by entering discount code
FOWLER6626 during checkout (this offer expires on August 17). InformIT
is also running an offer where you get a 30 day trial to
Safari Books Online if you place an order on InformIT. </p>

<p>The book has now completed production and has gone off to the
printers. As I understand it the final ebook will appear when the
printed book appears on August 17. Until then Safari subscribers can
still read the <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780133036138">rough cut</a>, which includes the copy-edited text, but
lacks the final layout and index.</p>

<p>The final book has 172 pages, which is sadly longer than we’d
hoped. We hope you’ll forgive us for that.</p>
