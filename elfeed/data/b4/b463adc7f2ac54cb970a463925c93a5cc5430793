<p>It’s been going on for a bit, but I’ve been tardy in letting people
know. Addison-Wesley are currently having <a href="http://www.informit.com/promotions/promotion.aspx?promo=138302">a promotion on signature series
books</a>. You get 40% off if you buy through informIT and buy at
least two books in any of the series (ie mine, Kent’s or Mike’s). </p>
