<p>Code folding is a feature I've never really used, and for the most part
seem to have done find without. I generally use search to navigate from
place to place in my code, but I realize this isn't always the most
efficient way to go, and code folding is very useful in a couple
aspects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It helps focus me on what particular method or class I'm working on
(way harder to tell when you've got several bunches of code in front
of you at once)</li>
<li>Getting a good idea of the structure of the code (with everything
folded, it's much easier to see)</li>
</ul>
</p><p>So I decided to play around with folding with my current development
environment. I use Emacs as my base, but <a class="reference external" href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ViperMode">viper-mode</a> for the actual
text editing.</p>
<p>Emacs has some pretty good folding tools built-in. Namely, these are
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FoldingMode">FoldingMode</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HideShow">HideShow</a>. I admit I didn't play around with
FoldingMode a lot, as using it seems to involve manually adding the
folding points, something which I think is unnecessary 90% of the time.
Ideally, I'm looking for a folding extension that automatically
determines folding points, and leaves things as hands-off for me as
possible. One should be able to open a file, fold it up, and then open
and fold as necessary. I'm not looking to waste time adding commented
blocks of folding everywhere.</p>
<p>Thats where HideShow comes in. Armed with rules for an array of
programming languages, HideShow automatically looks for these patterns
and sets folding points appropriately. Exactly what I'm looking for.
Simply loading hideshow using .emacs:</p>
<p><pre class="literal-block">
(load-library &quot;hideshow&quot;)
</pre>
</p><p>And activate the hideshow minor mode whenever you load the major mode of
your choice (for me it's Python):</p>
<p><pre class="literal-block">
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'hs-minor-mode)
</pre>
</p><p>Now you have all the access to the wonderful world of dynamic folding!
Unfortunately, I didn't really like the cumbersome keystrokes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>C-c &#64; M-C-s to unfold all</li>
<li>C-c &#64; C-h to fold</li>
<li>C-c &#64; C-s to unfold</li>
<li>C-c &#64; M-C-h to fold all</li>
<li>C-c &#64; C-c to toggle folding</li>
</ul>
</p><p>Yeah, a six key-stroke succession is too much for me. So I assigned
these bindings to almost the same folding commands as VIM:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>zm to unfold</li>
<li>zr to fold</li>
<li>zM to unfold all</li>
<li>zR to fold all</li>
<li>zt to toggle</li>
</ul>
</p><p>To do this, I added configuration into the .viper file:</p>
<p><pre class="literal-block">
(define-key viper-vi-global-user-map &quot;zt&quot; 'hs-toggle-hiding)(define-key viper-vi-global-user-map &quot;zM&quot; 'hs-hide-all)(define-key viper-vi-global-user-map &quot;zm&quot; 'hs-hide-block)(define-key viper-vi-global-user-map &quot;zR&quot; 'hs-show-all)(define-key viper-vi-global-user-map &quot;zr&quot; 'hs-show-block)
</pre>
</p><p>(viper-vi-global-user-map tell viper it's for any buffer in any state
with viper as a major mode). So far, this is working like a charm for
me. Here's a screenshot with it at work:</p>
