<p>Starting today I&#8217;m going to post a free excerpt from <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer</a> every week (time permitting) until I&#8217;ve posted them all. (Thanks to <a href="http://pragprog.com">my generous publisher</a> for allowing this!)</p>

<p>If you have read it and wished you could share sections with friends and co-workers that don&#8217;t own the book, now&#8217;s your chance. If you haven&#8217;t read it and really don&#8217;t want to spend money on it, you can read it for free (out of order) over the course of the next year.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to hear your reactions (via twitter, blog posts, hacker news comments, etc.) to each chapter as I post them. I released the first edition of the book eight years ago, and I always hear bits and pieces of feedback on the book in general. I&#8217;m hoping this gives me and the book&#8217;s readers a chance to focus discussion on each concept.</p>

<p>The first post is one of my favorites and one that gets little attention. It&#8217;s about &#8220;value rigidity&#8221; and the human tendency to hold on to things that are important to them so tightly that they can&#8217;t detect a change in context. I talk about this concept somewhat narrowly in the book, but I constantly see its application in daily life.  For me it&#8217;s a very useful mirror in which to inspect my behaviors.</p>
