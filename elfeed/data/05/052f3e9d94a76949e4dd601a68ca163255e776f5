<p>ThoughtWorks has launched a <a href="http://continuous-delivery.thoughtworks.com/">microsite devoted to Continuous
Delivery</a>. At the moment youâ€™ll find some short videos from the
ThoughtWorks Live event we did in May, plus links to recent writing by
Jez Humble (oops, now I have to call him the <a href="http://drdobbs.com/joltawards/231500080?pgno=7">award-winning</a> Jez
Humble). We also post details of our upcoming events in the field of
Continuous Delivery and Devops.</p>
