<p>I find that enabling the microphone with Alsa is very painful. Here is
a detailed step by step explanation</p>

<p>You'll need to launch <code>alsamixer</code> from a console.</p>

<p>Use the left arrow key till you get to the <code>Capture</code> channel. Press the
space key you should see <code>CAPTUR</code> on top of the bar in red. Next
increase the channel volume with the up key.</p>

<p>Make sure that you you have <code>Mic1</code> selected on the <code>Mic Select</code>
channel. Last it can be a good idea to unmute the <code>Mic Boost</code> channel to
amplify your microphone input.</p>

<p>Now that was really simple wasn't it? Yeah right...</p>
