<p>Iâ€™ll be joining my colleague Jez Humble to give another of our
tutorials on Continuous Delivery at <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2011/presentations/show_presentation.jsp?oid=3172">goto; Aarhus</a>. This is the
rebranded incarnation of JAOO - which has been my favorite conference for a long time now. This will be our first time doing the full day continuous delivery tutorial in Aarhus.</p>
