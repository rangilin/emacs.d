  <p>
    At <a href="http://fosdem.org/" target="_blank">FOSDEM</a> on the 2nd of February 2014 members of the Go


    community presented a series of talks in the Go Devroom. The day was a huge


    success, with 13 great talks presented to a consistently jam-packed room.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Video recordings of the talks are now available, and a selection of these


    videos are presented below.

  <h4 id="TOC_2.">Scaling with Go: YouTube&#39;s Vitess</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    Google Engineer Sugu Sougoumarane described how he and his


    team built <a href="https://github.com/youtube/vitess" target="_blank">Vitess</a> in Go to help scale 


    <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Vitess is a set of servers and tools primarily developed in Go.


    It helps scale MySQL databases for the web, and is currently used as a


    fundamental component of YouTube&#39;s MySQL infrastructure.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    The talk covers some history about how and why the team chose Go, and how it


    paid off.


    Sugu also talks abou tips and techniques used to scale Vitess using Go.

  <h4 id="TOC_3.">Camlistore</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://camlistore.org/" target="_blank">Camlistore</a> is designed to be &#34;your personal storage


    system for life, putting you in control, and designed to last.&#34; It&#39;s open


    source, under nearly 4 years of active development, and extremely flexible.  In


    this talk, Brad Fitzpatrick and Mathieu Lonjaret explain why they built it,


    what it does, and talk about its design.

  <h4 id="TOC_4.">Write your own Go compiler</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    Elliot Stoneham explains the potential for Go as a portable language and


    reviews the Go tools that make that such an exciting possibility.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    He said: &#34;Based on my experiences writing an experimental Go to Haxe


    translator, I&#39;ll talk about the practical issues of code generation and runtime


    emulation required. I&#39;ll compare some of my design decisions with those of two


    other Go compiler/translators that build on the go.tools library. My aim is to


    encourage you to try one of these new &#39;mutant&#39; Go compilers. I hope some of you


    will be inspired to contribute to one of them or even to write a new one of


    your own.&#34;
