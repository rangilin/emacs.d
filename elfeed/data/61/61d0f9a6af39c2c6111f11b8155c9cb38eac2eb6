<p>Good news everyone !</p>
<p>After more than a year in the making, <a href="http://TeamLeadSkills.com" target="_blank">the text version of my book for team leaders</a> is in final production stages, and the audio version is now already available.</p>
<p><a href="http://audio.5whys.com" target="_blank">You can purchase the audio book in this link,</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/Notes-to-a-Software-Team-Leader-Audiobook/B00FASCIVG?source_code=soc_twi_nr&amp;">on Audible.com</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had it professionally narrated, and I think this book has some sound advice that will actually help you at work.</p>
<p>The Audio book contains 4 hours of professionally narrated audio in 31 chapters. Here`s a sample from chapter 1:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The audio will be available in several formats:</p>
<ol>
<li>Separate Chapter Based mp3s </li>
<li>An .m4b file playable as an ITunes Audio Book</li>
</ol>
<p>All these will be included in the zip file that you get upon purchase if you get it at gumroad.com (audible has their own format which is not DRM free I'm afraid).</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it. I know I never have enough time to read all the books I want, so I`m happy that this book`s content lends itself to an audio format, that one can listen to in the car or in a gym.</p>
<p>If you have any comments or feedback, please let me know in the comments :)</p>
