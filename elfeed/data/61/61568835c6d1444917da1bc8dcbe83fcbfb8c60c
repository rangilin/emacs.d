  Everybody knows about moving Control to Caps Lock. These are my
  extra neat tricks for my MacBook Pro:
</p>

<hr/>

<pre class="code-snippet">
(setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)
(setq mac-option-modifier 'super)
(setq ns-function-modifier 'hyper)</pre>

<hr/>

<p>
  First of all, Meta <kbd>M-</kbd> needs to be really easy to hit. On a Mac
  keyboard, that means Command - and not the default Option - since
  we want the key that is right next to Space.
</p>

<p>
  The good news is that now Option is available for
  Super <kbd>s-</kbd>. And even more amazing, you can also bind the
  Function-key to Hyper <kbd>H-</kbd> - without losing the ability to
  change the volume or pause/play.
</p>

<p>
  So now I can use crazy keybindings
  like <kbd>H-SPC</kbd> <em>hyperspace</em>. I haven't entirely
  decided what I should be using this newfound superpower for, but one
  thing I've done is reserve all the <kbd>C-s-</kbd> prefixed letters for
  refactorings with <a href="https://github.com/magnars/js2-refactor.el">js2-refactor</a>,
  as you can <a href="https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d/blob/master/users/fimasvee/js2r-keys.el">see here</a>.
