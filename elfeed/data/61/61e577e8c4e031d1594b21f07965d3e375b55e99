<p>When programming I tend to shuffle lines around a lot.</p>

<hr/>

<pre class="code-snippet">
(<span class="keyword">defun</span> <span class="function-name">move-line-down</span> ()
  (interactive)
  (<span class="keyword">let</span> ((col (current-column)))
    (<span class="keyword">save-excursion</span>
      (forward-line)
      (transpose-lines 1))
    (forward-line)
    (move-to-column col)))

(<span class="keyword">defun</span> <span class="function-name">move-line-up</span> ()
  (interactive)
  (<span class="keyword">let</span> ((col (current-column)))
    (<span class="keyword">save-excursion</span>
      (forward-line)
      (transpose-lines -1))
    (move-to-column col)))

(global-set-key (kbd <span class="string">"&lt;C-S-down&gt;"</span>) 'move-line-down)
(global-set-key (kbd <span class="string">"&lt;C-S-up&gt;"</span>) 'move-line-up)</pre>

<p>
  Maybe not when I program elisp, since that's sexp-based, but for
  other programming languages these two come in very handy. They
  simply move the current line one step up or down.
