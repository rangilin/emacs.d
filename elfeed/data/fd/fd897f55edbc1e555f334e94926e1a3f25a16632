<p>I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/martinfowler">been using Twitter</a> for a few years to post about what
I’m up to, new activity on martinfowler.com, and other interesting
things I find on the internets. Facebook has a facility to feed
twitter activity to a Facebook page, which is handy for people who
prefer tracking my posts on Facebook rather than Twitter. So I’ve set
up a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/martinFowlerThoughtWorks">Facebook page to channel my tweets</a>. If you “like”
that page, Facebook will add my tweets to your Facebook news feed.</p>

<p>I don’t intend to do anything more with this page than be a channel
for my tweets, so this won’t be anything new for people who
use Twitter, but I’m giving it a try to see if at least some people
prefer to use Facebook.</p>
