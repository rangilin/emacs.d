chapters finish with a section of key points - short bullets that
summarize the content of the chapter. Iâ€™ve now turned these into a web
page that thus provides a summary of the key points of the book -
which can act is a quick refresher for those that have the book and an
indication of the content of the book for those who are contemplating
buying it.</p>
