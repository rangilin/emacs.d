<p>I have put up with slowness when sending e-mail for a long time now.
The server software called Exim would take forever before accepting
what I was sending.</p>

<p>After much searching I found out it was doing an ident. It might be a
good idea for slowing down spammers. However, for my use, I have sped
it up by adding the following line in my configuration file:</p>

<pre class="example">
rfc1413_hosts = !*.bbox.fr : *
</pre>

<p>It turns off ident for my home network that ends in bbox.fr.</p>
