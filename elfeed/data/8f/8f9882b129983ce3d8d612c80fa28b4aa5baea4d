  Behold the very first lines in my <code>.emacs.d/init.el</code>:

<pre class="code-snippet">
<span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">Turn off mouse interface early in startup to avoid momentary display
</span>(<span class="keyword">if</span> (fboundp 'menu-bar-mode) (menu-bar-mode -1))
(<span class="keyword">if</span> (fboundp 'tool-bar-mode) (tool-bar-mode -1))
(<span class="keyword">if</span> (fboundp 'scroll-bar-mode) (scroll-bar-mode -1))

<span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">No splash screen please ... jeez
</span>(setq inhibit-startup-message t)</pre>

<p>
  They hide the menu bar, tool bar, scroll bar and splash screen.
  Doing so early avoids ever having to see them - not even for a brief
  flash when starting Emacs.
</p>
<p>
  These four lines move us into the tranquil zone of <em>nothing but
    the text</em>. A raster interface can never hold the seeming
  infinitude of Emacs functionality, so we just let it go.

    "What I don't understand is: why should you ever care how your editor
    looks, unless you're trying to win a screenshot competition? The
    primary factor in looking good should be the choice of a good font
    at a comfortable size, and a syntax coloring theme that you like.
    And that is not something specific to an editor. Editors like Emacs
    and vi have almost no UI! If Emacs is configured right, the only UI
    it has is the modeline and the minibuffer."
