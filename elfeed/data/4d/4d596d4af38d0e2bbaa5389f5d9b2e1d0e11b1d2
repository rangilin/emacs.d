<p>Welcome to part 2! This post discusses installing Webpagetest.org. In
order to do so, we will need:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A windows machine (XP or Windows 7 have been tested with this method)</li>
<li>Apache2.2 or higher</li>
<li>PHP5 or higher</li>
<li>IE of some sort (IE8 or 9 would be best)</li>
<li>ffmpeg</li>
</ul>
</p><p>It is possible to split up the web server and the testing server, but I
put them both on the same machine for ease of use. In addition I found
installing and configuring Apache and PHP together on windows was
surprisingly difficult, so I suggest installing <a class="reference external" href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html">Xampp</a>. It's a
single-install program that includes many of the tools used for serving
web pages and web development, such as Apache, PHP5, MySQL, and
Filezilla. Windows 7 machines have IE 8 installed by default, but
upgrading is straightforward for XP machines.</p>
<p>Once you have your machine set up properly, it's time to install
Webpagetest! You can download the source here: <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/webpagetest/downloads/list">Webpagetest.org
source</a>.</p>
<p>There are also installation instructions on the webpagetest.org google
site. I would recommend following these fora a complete guide, but what
I have written is a shorter version and will attain the same result.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/private-instances">https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/private-instances</a></p>
<p>Configure Apache to point to the www directory of your source, or move
the contents of the folder to the &quot;htdocs&quot; folder under Xampp (I found
that the Virtualhost directive in Apache was having issues, so I just
threw everything into the htdocs folder, where Xampp is initially
configured to point to). I found that on the windows machine, giving
read/write permissions to the directories needed was not an issue.</p>
<p>You will then have to configure everything properly. This involves
basically copying and pasting everything in the settings folder to it's
non-sample equivalent. I was able to do this because I wanted a basic
instance, but keep in mind you may need to do more if you want more
complex options.</p>
<p>Configuring the system to run the tests is best explained, verbatim from
the private-instance setup site linked above:</p>
<ol></p><p><li><p>Configure the test system to automatically log-on to an administrator
account. Running &quot;control userpasswords2&quot; from the start menu is one way
to configure it.</p>
</li></p><p><li><p>Disable any screen savers (the desktop needs to remain visible for the
video capture to work)</p>
</li></p><p><li><p>Disable UAC (Vista or later - slide to &quot;never notify&quot;)</p>
</li></p><p><li><p>Uninstall IE Enhanced-Security Mode (Windows Server)</p>
</li></p><p><li><p>Copy the test software from the <strong>agent</strong> folder to the system (to
&quot;c:\webpagetest&quot; for this example)</p>
</li></p><p><li><p>Install the DUMMYNET ipfw driver</p>
</p><ul class="simple">
<li>Pull up the properties for the Network Adapter that is used to access
the Internet</li>
<li>Click &quot;Install&quot;</li>
<li>Select &quot;Service&quot; and click &quot;Add&quot;</li>
<li>Click &quot;Have Disk&quot; and navigate to c:\webpagetest\dummynet</li>
<li>Select the ipfw+dummynet service (and click through any warnings
about the driver being unsigned)</li>
</ul>
</p><p></li></p><p><li><p>Create a shortcut to c:\webpagetest\dummynet\ipfw.cmd in the startup
folder</p>
</li></p><p><li><p>Create a shortcut to c:\webpagetest\urlblast.exe in the startup folder</p>
</li></p><p><li><p>Make a copy of the settings file (urlblast.ini) based on the sample</p>
</li></p><ul class="simple">
<li>Give it the path to the server (default configuration points to a
server on the local machine)</li>
<li>Configure the location to match the location defined on the server in
locations.ini (if modified)</li>
<li>Configure the location key to match the server in locations.ini (if
modified)</li>
</ul>
</p><p><li><p>Reboot to make sure everything starts up correctly</p>
</li></p><p></ol></p><p><strong>Note:</strong>On windows 7, ipfw will not properly install (it will not
show up under installable services). If you want to use windows 7, you
must add a &quot;Location = LAN&quot; directive under test in settings.inc in
settings:</p>
<p><pre class="literal-block">
[Test]Location = LAN
</pre>
</p><p>After that, your instance should be set up! Now that wasn't so bad, was
it?</p>
<p>Next time we'll talk about installing HttpArchive!</p>
