<p>I used eww on 24.3 that I back ported. I had a small issue in gnus so I
decided to migrate to emacs trunk. Since it's in feature freeze it
should be pretty usable.</p>

<p>I then spent two days investigating the bugs that I was finding. I
published 4 bugs:</p>

<ul>
<li>#16721 I can't display Unicode 6.2 (the ext font library is broken
I guess)</li>

<li>#16701 and #16702 When I run flyspell when composing e-mail the
keyboard gets messed up using international input</li>

<li>#14573 The scroll to bottom module in ERC is broken. That's not a
regression though. It was broken in 24.3. Eli and I are talking
about this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally I spent a lot of time investigating slow typing in org mode.
It turned out it was my jumpc code. I have disabled it. Since I am not
using it so I am not planning on fixing it.</p>
