<p>I've <a href='http://blog.codinghorror.com/todont/' >expressed my disillusionment with to-do lists</a> before. </p>

<p>But let's try something simpler, a little experiment. <strong>What do you use to keep track of what you need to do?</strong> Hold it up, so I can see it. Humor me.</p>

<p>Seriously! No no no, hold it closer, near the screen here. Let me look at it. Let me get a <em>good, long</em> look at it.</p>

<p>Now imagine me slapping this thing out of your hand.</p>

<p><img src='http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/Apr/dont-go-there.png'  alt="don't go there" /></p>

<p>I just want to make a point, not break your fancy whatchamacallit. So pretend I slapped it into a soft fluffy pillow on the ground, not the hard concrete of the sidewalk. Though I probably should have.</p>

<p>Whatever that thing is, it's a crutch. You don't need it. It's <a href='http://blog.codinghorror.com/todont/' >hurting you more than it is helping</a>. Get rid of it.</p>

<p>Instead, ask yourself this:</p>

<h2 id="whatthreethingsdoyouneedtodotoday">What three things do you need to do today?</h2>

<p>You should be able to instantly answer this simple question, each day, every day, for the rest of your life. <em>Without</em> any tools other than the brain you were born with.</p>

<p>If you don't have this skill, develop it. Practice, starting today. Right now.</p>

<p>What <em>are</em> you doing right now? Is it going to somehow result in one of those three things getting done today? Will this you get you to where you need to be by the end of the day?</p>

<p>I'm not asking you to admonish yourself or to make any changes to your routine. Just keep it simple, focus on the important things, and add a little layer of awareness. </p>

<p>So. Two items left. I'm doing <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_05qJTeNNI' >pretty good</a> today. </p>
