<p><a href="http://chadfowler.com/blog/2013/07/16/passionate-programmer-a-free-excerpt-almost-every-week/">As I mentioned last week,</a> I&#8217;m releasing chapters of <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer</a> every(ish) week until they&#8217;ve all been posted.</p>

<p>This week&#8217;s chapter is one I actually re-read myself sometimes as a reminder. It&#8217;s about how to stay calm  and focused in the face of stress. It&#8217;s one of the most important lessons I&#8217;ve learned (and continue to learn) throughout my career and applies to every job I&#8217;ve had. Too often, our reaction to stress is to freak out and <em>just</em> <em>start</em> <em>trying</em> <em>shit</em>.</p>

<p>In the chapter, I mention a Doom deathmatch player who went by the name &#8220;Noskill&#8221;.  I learned after the release of the book that Noskill aka Chris Crosby had <a href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Chris_Crosby_(NoSkill)">died in a car accident at the age of 23</a>. As weird as it is, I hope Chris&#8217;s family discovers that he somehow influenced my career and appeared in a book for software developers, perhaps some of whom will go on to work on the games he loved so much.</p>

<p>Anyway, here it is.  <a href="http://chadfowler.com/passionate-programmer/panic.html">Don&#8217;t Panic</a>.</p>
