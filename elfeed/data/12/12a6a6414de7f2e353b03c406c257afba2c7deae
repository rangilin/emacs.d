"Why are macros so important to Lisp programmers? Not merely for the
syntactic convenience they provide, but because they are programs that
manipulate programs, which has always been a central theme in the Lisp
community. If FORTRAN is the language that pushes numbers around, and
C is the language that pushes characters and pointers around, then
Lisp is the language that pushes programs around."

An old quote, but still thoroughly relevant. (Though today you'd
probably pick something in place of Fortran, and add a note about Java
being the language that pushes objects around.)
