Vim is the greatest text editor in the world.  <a href="/2012/06/programmers-your-text-editor-wasnt.html">I have strong opinions
about why this is so</a>, and why Eclipse &amp; co.'s editors are inadequate
by design, but that's for another day. No, this is just a quick post
to say the Vim vs. Emacs wars are over. I'm a Vim user, but if you

our energy. There are people out there writing code in Notepad FFS&#x2026;
