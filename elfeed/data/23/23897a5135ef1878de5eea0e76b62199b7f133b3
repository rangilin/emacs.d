<p>When I program I find that it is difficult to pick a name for a
function or a variable. Here is my rule of thumb.</p>

<p>Functions are usually actions. Therefore I name them accordingly with
a verb first then an object:</p>

<ul>
<li>generate-first-deck</li>
<li>pick-letter</li>
<li>begin-game</li>
</ul>

<p>Some functions return a boolean. In this case I put the subject first
and the verb next:</p>

<ul>
<li>word-exist</li>
<li>number-is-even</li>
<li>file-lock</li>
</ul>

<p>This is so that conditional statements resemble English:</p>

<ul>
<li>(if (word-exist</li>
<li>(when (not file-lock</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid double negative like the pest!</p>

<p>I name variables as explicitly as possible, I mostly use two word when
one is not sufficient. I never put and 's' at the end, it's a source
of typos. I don't abbreviate character to char or index to i. What you
gain in typing is lost in refactoring or code reading. Here are some
variables I created recently</p>

<ul>
<li>time-left</li>
<li>bad-word</li>
<li>deck-letter</li>
</ul>

<p>That's how I do it now, it will probably change in the future ;)</p>
