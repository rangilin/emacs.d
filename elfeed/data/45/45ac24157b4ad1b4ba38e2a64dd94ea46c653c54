<p>Helped my customer set up tomcat to serve his JSP pages on a
prototype. I helped him setup PostgreSQL as well. The technology is
quite neat as you just need to drop a .war file that includes all
your pages and scripts. We had to use Skype on Windows to
communicate. I don't like using windows but we had endless
disconnect with gnomemeeting.</p>
