<p>Let's say I have the directory gnupg in my repository. How do I get
the tree-ish SHA1 of gnupg? Well, the trick is to specify the name of
the directory after the SHA1.</p>

<pre class="example">
git ls-tree master gnupg | awk '{print $3}'
</pre>

<p>You can recurse to find nested directories.</p>
