<p>As in so many previous years, I’ll be speaking at the the <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2011/">goto
conference</a> (formerly known as JAOO) in early October. This is an
excellent conference with a good range of material across both
technology and process. This year I’ll be participating in a pair of
tutorials.</p>

<p>On Oct 9 I’ll be with Jez Humble doing our full-day tutorial on
Continuous Delivery, the first time we’ve brought this tutorial to
Aarhus. This will cover much of the ground in Jez and Dave’s award
winning book including the business case for Continuous Delivery,
deployment pipelines, testing strategies, version control
organization, and recipes for going live. We’ve had a lot of good
feedback on this tutorial so far, so I’m glad to finally bring this to
my favorite conference.</p>

<p>On Oct 13 I’ll join Rebecca Parsons to talk about Evolutionary
Architecture. Rebecca’s long been our chief technical firefighter on
difficult projects, which often have complicated dependencies to
enterprise architecture. I’ve long been urging her to talk more about
her experiences and techniques for handling these issues, so it will
be good to work with her on this tutorial.</p>

<p>In between I’ll be hanging around the conference catching up on all
the good pickings that will be available.</p>
