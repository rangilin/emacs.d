<p>This is a screencast that introduces the basics of the editor and talks about the special meanings of terms like &#8220;window&#8221;, &#8220;frame&#8221; etc. that are often used in Emacs.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the first one which I&#8217;ve done so feedback is welcome. Please email me at <a href="mailto:noufal@emacsmovies.org">noufal@emacsmovies.org</a> or tweet to <a href="http://twitter.com/emacsmovies">@emacsmovies</a> to let me know what you think.</p>
