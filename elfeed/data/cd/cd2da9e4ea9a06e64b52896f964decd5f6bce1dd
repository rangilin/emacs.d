<p>This post discusses the <code>region</code>, the <code>point</code>, the <code>mark</code> and related matters. It generally deals with the business of cutting and pasting within Emacs. It&#8217;s a little longer than the others and a little less structured but I think the future screencasts are going to be that way anyway.</p>

<p>The video sizes are unnaturally huge this time. I&#8217;ll probably scale them down from now.</p>

<p>The H.264 version of the video for iOS devices is at <a href="http://archive.org/download/EmacsMovies/04-episode-region.mkv">http://archive.org/download/EmacsMovies/04-episode-region.mkv</a>.</p>
