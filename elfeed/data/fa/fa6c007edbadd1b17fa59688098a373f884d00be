<p>The first section is where I capture stuff. My weekly review is a
natural process. I start at the top and type 'w' to refile. Using
speed keys really help. If you don't know about it check out the
documentation in the function <code>org-speed-command-help</code>.</p>

<p>Then I go through each section and see what needs to be done. I tried
to be ruthless and put stuff in someday or maybe so that my list is
current and feels fresh.</p>

<p>I then finish with things that are in someday (one day I will do it)
to maybe (who knows?).</p>

<p>That pretty much sums up how I implement GTD with org mode.</p>
