<p>As a side note, it was in <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com">Dave Thomas&#8217;s</a> original edits for the book in 2005 that, through his pull-quote &#8220;Vendor-centric views are typically myopic&#8221;, I learned the word &#8220;myopic&#8221;. I&#8217;ve learned two other words from Dave in my life: &#8220;anodyne&#8221; and &#8220;octothorpe&#8221;. Thanks, Dave!</p>
