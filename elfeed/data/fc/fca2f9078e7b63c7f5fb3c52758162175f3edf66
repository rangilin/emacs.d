Jon Snader <a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=2828">over at Irreal</a> mentioned that Trey Harris shared on G+ how
to use a fallback font for Unicode Symbols. I won't repeat what they
said here, you've probably seen it already (and if you haven't then
go). I merely come to offer my own solution to this predicament, which
doesn't require any package installation and is pretty configurable to boot.

<p>
I ran into this a few months ago, while optimising my jabber+gtalk
setup, and the answer turns out to be remarkably simple. After
installing <i>Symbola</i> on your system, it's a 1-line solution.
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">set-fontset-font</span> <span class="s">&quot;fontset-default&quot;</span> <span class="no">nil</span> 
                  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">font-spec</span> <span class="ss">:size</span> <span class="mi">20</span> <span class="ss">:name</span> <span class="s">&quot;Symbola&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span></code></pre></div>

Some remarks:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you just glanced over that, go back and read the first
function's name. Now try to say it 3 times quickly.
</li>
<li>The <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/set-fontset-font">documentation</a> of <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/set-fontset-font"><code>set-fontset-font</code></a> doesn't even remotely allude
to the fact it can be used for setting a fallback fonts. Makes me
wonder its intended purpose.
</li>
<li>The <code>:size 20</code> argument (which you're free to remove) increases the
size of this font only. It's useful because some complex unicode
symbols are hard to see in small font.
</li>
<li>The <code>nil</code> would allow you to restrict the range of glyphs affected
by this font. Setting it to <code>nil</code> makes it the fallback font.
</li>
</ul>
