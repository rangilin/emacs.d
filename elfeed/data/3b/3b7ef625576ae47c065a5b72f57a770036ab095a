<p>While uploading the recent <a href="http://flycheck.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changes.html#apr-13-2013">0.9 release</a> of Flycheck, I realized that Flycheck has just had its half year anniversary.</p>
<p>Just half a year ago, at October 11th 2012, I published the first version of what was to become Flycheck. At this time however I still called it “flymake-checkers”, and indeed it was just a tiny collection of some <a href="https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/tree/0.1">Flymake checkers</a> I had created for my personal use.</p>
<p>Now, just half a year later, it is a fully fledged, independent <a href="https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/tree/0.9">replacement for Flymake</a>, with a considerable amount of <a href="https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/blob/0.9/flycheck.el#L84">built-in checkers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/tree/0.9#features">many cool features</a>, and <a href="http://flycheck.github.io/">comprehensive documentation</a>.</p>
<p>This would not have been possible without <a href="https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/tree/0.9#credits">many helping hands</a>, who added reported bugs, gave feedback, contributed new syntax checkers or even new features. If you are a Flycheck user, be sure to give these awesome people some Kudos.</p>
<p>I would like to thank all users and contributors of Flycheck for your continuing help and support. It is honor and fun to me to provide Flycheck to such awesome people.</p>
