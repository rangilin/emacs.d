<p>About a year ago I stumbled upon an excellent <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Hewitt-Meijer-and-Szyperski-The-Actor-Model-everything-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask">ad-hoc explanation from Carl
Hewitt on the Actor
Model</a>.
Carl Hewitt is the creator of the Actor model. The Actor model has been famously
implemented by <a href="http://joearms.github.io/">Joe Armstrong</a> in the Erlang
programming language. With the recent purchase of WhatsApp by Facebook for
billions of dollars, Erlang, and to a lesser extent the Actor model, have all
seen an uptick in interest because of WhatsApp&#39;s use of Erlang.</p>

<p>Personally, in the past year or so I&#39;ve become fascinated with studying the many
concurrency models. Learning about event loops, process forking,
multi-threading and channels was rather straight forward as they were somewhat
easy to conceputalize technically. The Actor model was easy to conceptualize
visually, a bunch of entities communicating with each other by sharing
messages, but hard for me to understand technically.</p>

<p>I really wanted to understand the Actor model so I took some notes while I was
watching the video. I&#39;ve put the <a href="https://gist.github.com/rbishop/9082539">notes in a gist on
GitHub</a> for others to see, comment on
and hopefully make even better. I think understanding concurrency
implementations should be important to Rubyists. Language performance does
matter and if the right abstractions are what takes Ruby from a slow but
enjoyable language to a medium/fast and enjoyable language I think that is a
huge win. Ruby also happens to have an implementation of Actors named
<a href="https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid">Celluloid</a> that is gaining
considerable traction. It&#39;s exciting times to say the least.</p>

<p>The video is from some sort of Microsoft event where Carl Hewitt gets pulled
into a room and is asked questions about the Actor model from a few other
seemingly really smart guys. The result is a great video really breaking down
the Actor model. Below are links to the video as well as my gist of notes:</p>
