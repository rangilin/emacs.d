Computer scientists are some of the most in-demand professionals in today’s job market. Hundreds of thousands around the world are pursuing careers in computer science, but the field is constantly changing, where important programming languages today may lose their relevance tomorrow. Teaching computer science, and teaching it well, is a core value at Coursera (especially because our first courses were Machine Learning and Probabilistic Graphical Models). 
</p><p>
Since then, Coursera has worked with professors at the top of their fields to offer learners the chance to acquire knowledge and skills in this fast-moving and diverse career field. Whether you’re looking to write your first line of code, build Android Apps or advance the next breakthrough in robotics, there is a class on Coursera that can help you get there.

<p>
Python is the most popular coding language taught in top US universities at the introductory level, having recently overtaken Java. These two classes offer both theoretical and practical knowledge of Python, so it’s ideal for beginners. As a bonus, the Rice University course includes projects building fun games like Pong, Blackjack, and Asteroids!

Also, learning how to code won’t only land you coding-specific jobs. One of our learners, an undergraduate student in India, learned Python through Coursera. When interviewing at a consulting firm, he impressed his interviewer with his understanding of the programming language and got the job. Aspiring coders can take these courses and impress employers with both their new knowledge and problem-solving abilities.

An Information Security Analyst is <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/06/07/the-4-best-paying-high-demand-jobs-for-computer-sc.aspx" target="_blank">one of the fastest growing and lucrative jobs</a> in the computer science market, with the demand predicted to grow by 37% within the next eight years. Professor Mike Simmon’s course out of the University of Washington uses real-world case studies to help learners understand, design and deliver strategies for information security with a broad applicability. The course does require some prerequisite knowledge of cybersecurity and modeling.

Mobile has become the most important and widely-used medium for accessing computing services, and Google’s Android OS has the largest smartphone foothold in the world. This course, which is the first of a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/mobilecloudcomputing/2" target="_blank">Specialization</a>, is aimed at helping learners become an Android developer. The series is a collaboration between University of Maryland and Vanderbilt University, and puts an emphasis on both software engineering as well as user experience.

4. <b><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/insidetheinternet" target="_blank">Internet History, Technology, and Security</a>, University of Michigan</b></h3>

<p>
For learners looking for a broad overview of the field, look no further than Internet History, Technology, and Security taught by one of Coursera’s most enthusiastic professors (who, fun fact, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slscHD40r78" target="_blank">has a Coursera tattoo</a>!). 
</p><p>
“Dr. Chuck”, as his students call him, regularly hosts “office hours” all over the U.S. whenever he travels. He holds these sessions in local coffee shops and invites all interested students to attend. One of our learners in Shreveport, Louisiana was so inspired by Dr. Chuck’s enthusiasm for the material that he decided to go back to school after a 25-year hiatus. He will graduate this fall with an associate’s degree from the Florida Institute of Technology!
