<p>Due to a bug in Gnus I need to fetch my e-mail in a mbox file. After
looking around the manual of fetchmail I couldn't find a way to do
this easily.</p>

<p>Someone on #emacs suggested getmail. I think it's really cool and
easy to setup. The installation lacks a quick recipe so here we
go. You'll need to create /.getmail/getmailrc with something like:</p>

<pre class="example">
[retriever]
type = SimplePOP3Retriever
server = smtp.kanis.fr
username = ivan@foo.com
password = mysecretpassword

[destination]
type = Mboxrd
path = ~/tmp/ivan.mbox

[options]
delete = true
</pre>

<p>You'll need to create an empty mbox file:</p>

<pre class="example">
touch ~/tmp/ivan.mboxc
</pre>

<p>You are all set!</p>
