<p>Addison-Wesley is doing a <a href="http://www.informit.com/promotions/promotion.aspx?promo=138302">promotion</a> on books in their signature
series. This includes all the books in <a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/">my signature series</a>, but also
the other signers: Kent Beck and Mike Cohn. The deal is that if you buy two or
more signature series books from <a href="http://www.informit.com">InformIT</a> you get 40% off. The offer
is good for physical and electronic books and is on until the end of
2012. To get the discount, use the discount code AWSS2012 during
check-out. All my books pages have links to the relevant
InformIT page - they do a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/buying.html">good arrangement for multi-format ebooks</a>.</p>
