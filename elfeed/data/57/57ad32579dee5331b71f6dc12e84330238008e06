<p>It's harder than it should be. If you do a regular MacPorts install it
will crash because it doesn't have the ElemenTree module.</p>

<p>So here's a quick recipe using bzr source code:</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo port install py26-celementtree py26-elementtree
sudo port install py26-crypto py26-curl py26-distribute
sudo port install py26-paramiko py26-pyrex
sudo port select --set python python26
cd ~/src/bzr-2.4b5
python setup.py install --home ~/local
export PYTHONPATH=/Users/ivan/local/lib/python
export PATH=/Users/ivan/local/bin:$PATH
</pre>

<p>You should have a bzr that should be more usable than MacPorts. It's
still not working for me as it takes 3G of memory, hits the swap and
renders my computer useless.</p>
