<p>I can listen to the BBC radio again on Linux! It took me a little work
but the result is gratifying. Note that the pause, forward and volume
controls are now working. I am thrilled :)</p>

<p>I have compiled the Helix Player on Debian this morning and I have
taken the following notes.</p>

<p>You will need the Ogg Vorbis development file:</p>

<p><code>apt-get install libvorbis-dev</code></p>

<p>The player also depends on the <a href="http://www.theora.org/">Theora</a> codecs. These files are not
packaged in Debian yet. Grab the sources from the web site, unpack
them and type the following commands:</p>

<pre class="example">
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install
</pre>

<p>Once the dependences are taken care of you should be able to build
the player. Here is what my build environment looks like :</p>

<pre class="example">
Build System Menu
-&gt; Current Directory: /home/ivan/src/helix/helix
[0] Set BIF branch (helix-player)
[1] Set Target(s) (player_inst)
[2] Set Profile (/home/ivan/src/helix/build/umakepf/helix-client-all-defines)
[3] run: build -trelease
</pre>

<p>Next run the build by pressing 3. I have the self extracting
installer in the releasedirectory. So I ran the
following command:</p>

<p><code>./hxplay-0.3.0.59-linux-2.2-libc6-gcc32-i586.bin</code></p>

<p>The installer register the plugin to Mozilla and you should be able to
listen to the best <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio">radio</a> out there!</p>
