Types of infinite numbers and some things they apply to: Cardinals (set theory, applies to sizes of ordinals, sizes of Hilbert Spaces) Ordinals (set theory, used to create ordinal spaces, and in ordinal analysis. Noncommutative.) Beth Numbers (like Cardinals, or not, depending on continuum hypothesis stuff) Hyperreals (includes infinitesimals, good for analysis, computational geometry) Superreals [&#8230;]
