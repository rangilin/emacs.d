<p>In the software world, we have the <a href="http://drdobbs.com/joltawards">Jolt awards</a>. These were
originally run by Software Development magazine and are now run by Dr
Dobbs magazine. My books have won a couple of ‘productivity awards’ -
which are essentially the runner-up awards - but I’ve never snagged to
top award (now called the ‘excellence award’). This year my [DSL book][]
was up for an award and [won a ‘finalist award’][dsl jolt] (essentially this means
I was runner-up to the runner-ups). </p>

<p>So I failed again, but this year I would have been very annoyed if
I had won. I’ve argued all year that Jez and Dave’s book on [Continuous
Delivery][cd book] was the most important book released this year, and so I’m
glad that Dr Dobbs [agreed with me][cd jolt] and gave them the excellence award.
Congratulations to Jez and Dave in joining the long list of people who
have kept me away from this award.</p>

<p>Although I keep missing the top prize, my signature series has a very
good record with these awards. The 10 books in my series so far have
picked up 1 finalist, 4 productivity and 2
excellence awards. Not a bad hit rate.</p>
