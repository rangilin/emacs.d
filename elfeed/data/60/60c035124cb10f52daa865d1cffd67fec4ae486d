<p>The next logical step is to turn videos that I have downloaded and
transfer them to a CD. So far I had very little luck. It seems that my
Pioneer DVD player wants a video with 25 frame per second or I won't
get colors. The problem with mucking with fps is that A/V are out of
sync! It's been a bad day :(</p>
