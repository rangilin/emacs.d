<p>Earlier this year I gave a keynote at the Goto conference in Amsterdam. It’s now up on YouTube. As usual it follows my ‘Software Design in the 21st Century’ template with a pair of short talks. I begin with talking about <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/schemaless"><b>Schemaless data structures</b></a>, explaining why there is always an implicit schema and the consequences of that. Second up I talk about the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html"><b>essence of agile</b> software development</a> and the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/agileFluency.html"><b>agile fluency</b> model</a>.</p>
