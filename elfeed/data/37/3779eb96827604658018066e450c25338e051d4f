<p>You may have noticed some photos cropping up in my news feed. Like
many geeks I indulge in photography. So far this has been a harmless
personal diversion, but I’ve reached the point where I’m feeling a
desire to share some of my photos with the Internet - just in case we
have a shortage. So you’ll see photos appear in my photostream from
time to time. I intend to post no more than one or two a week.</p>
