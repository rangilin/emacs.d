My mother is asking for technical support 'for a friend'. She's
reminded me of this quick diagnostic tip that's worth noting:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Geek: What browser are you using?
</p>

<p>
Patient: What's a browser?
</p>
</blockquote>

They're using Internet Explorer. Someone might have installed a better
browser for them, but if they had someone like that in their lives,
they wouldn't turn to you for tech support.
