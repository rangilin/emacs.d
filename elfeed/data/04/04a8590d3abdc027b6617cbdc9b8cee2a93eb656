<p> Back in 2009 <a href="http://web.psung.name/">Phil Sung</a> taught a short course on being productive with Emacs. The slides from the course (<a href="http://web.psung.name/emacs/2009/part1.html">1</a>, <a href="http://web.psung.name/emacs/2009/part2.html">2</a>) are still available and well worth a look. Often times, slides from a talk without the actual presentation aren't that useful but I found it easy to follow these. They start with the usual basic movements, move onto more complex actions such as searching and replacing, binding commands to keystrokes, and keyboard macros. Finally, they cover basic Elisp and how to write your own functions. </p>
<p> The GNU <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/">Guided Tour of Emacs</a> is based on these slides and is also worth a look if you haven't already seen it. You might also want to check out Sung's <a href="http://web.psung.name/emacstips/essential.html">Ten Essential Emacs tips</a>. A slightly longer-form exposition of some of the same areas covered by the slides. Finally, you can read all his blog posts <a href="http://psung.blogspot.com/search/label/emacs">with an Emacs tag</a>. Those posts contain a number of useful tips. </p>
