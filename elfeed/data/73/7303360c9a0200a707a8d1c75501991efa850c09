during October. They are both evening events (Oct 17 Frankfurt and Oct
18 Berlin). I shall do my usual <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html">suite of talks</a> on
some mix of topics. I’ll be joined by two of my colleagues: Wolf
Schlegel, who will be talking about continuous delivery and Erik
Dörnenburg who will be talking about using lean techniques with
enterprise architecture. </p>
