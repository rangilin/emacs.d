<p>I spent the last few days trying to figure out why kphone wouldn't
work with my newly aquired Belkin router. The clue was the
following security log:</p>

<p><code>15.11.2004 19:36:52 **UDP Flood to Host** 192.168.2.3, 32860-&gt;&gt;</code></p>

<p>The problem is that the router thinks that SIP incoming packets are a
denial of service attack. You'll need to follow this
<a href="http://192.168.2.1/firewall_spi_h.stm">undocumented link</a>. Next turn off <code>SPI</code> and <code>Anti-DoS firewall protection</code>.</p>

<p>I find it most uncool that Belkin did not document this link. It would
have saved me a lot time had they mention it on their manual.</p>
