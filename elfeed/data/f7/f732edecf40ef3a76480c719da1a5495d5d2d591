<p>A year ago today I put up the <a href="http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/04/12/light-table---a-new-ide-concept/">original blog</a> post for <a href="http://www.lighttable.com/">Light Table</a>. It was just a simple video of a prototype I made in less than a week while I was visiting my grandparents without internet - at the time we had no idea what it would become. To be honest, I thought some would think it was neat, but then it would fade away like most &quot;neat&quot; things on the internet.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a wild ride this past year, from the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/306316578/light-table">kickstarter</a> to <a href="http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/05/17/light-table-is-in-yc/">joining YCombinator</a> to <a href="http://www.chris-granger.com/2013/01/24/the-ide-as-data/">experimental releases</a> and everything in between. One thing, however, has remained constant through all the ups and downs; you guys. The enthusiasm, the hope for something new and better, the willingness to bear with us as we try things that don&#39;t work or that aren&#39;t quite ready yet. Ultimately, Light Table is a project for and of the community and for that I can&#39;t thank you enough. There have certainly been times where I don&#39;t think we would&#39;ve made it without your support.</p>

<p>A couple days ago, we put out a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BVWA744iCQOHWD2m-lGHHinf37RTY-EfQy3Jjvh1s6s/viewform">survey</a> to gather some more information about what people think about the latest release and what they&#39;re most excited to see next. Once again, you guys showed us how amazing of a community you are and we got over 1100 responses in under 24 hours. Over the past couple days Robert and I have been going over what you guys said and we&#39;re happy to say that we were moving in the right general direction already and we&#39;re using that feedback to hone our plans. As a matter of fact, two of the biggest things people wanted to see are coming in the next release - Python eval and deeper JS integration - as well as a host of other things that were mentioned. This next release is slated before the end of april and it&#39;s going to be a big one with some surprises that I think you&#39;ll love.</p>

<p>Thank you again for being a part of this project and for believing in two crazy guys who set out to change 40 years of tradition... <strong>We can&#39;t wait to show you what&#39;s next.</strong></p>
