<p>Decided to typeset a lyrics booklet for a CD. Found the <code>cd-cover</code>
package at <a href="http://www.ctan.org/">CTAN</a> that does just that. I was sailing along till I tried
to print it. The Postscript file that it generates is in letter
instead of A4. It wouldn't be a big deal usually but I am trying to
print this double sided so it has to be centered just right. I'll
think about it later!</p>
