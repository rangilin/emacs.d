This kind of event tends to raise questions, so I organized <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/go-interview.html">an interview with Chad Wathington</a>, who is a Managing Director of ThoughtWorks Studios (our product division). He answers questions on why we did the open-sourcing, why we announced it before making the source available, about the name-clash with the go language, and our future plans for Go.</p>
