<p>Here is a little experiment. Below is the audio version of the Preface of my upcoming book &ldquo;<a href="http://TeamLeadSkills.com">Notes to a Software Team Leader</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I am thinking of turning this into a saleable audio book. How much should I charge for the entire book, with each chapter being an mp3 (book is about 110 pages)</p>
<p>and where should I sell it? (I do not live in the US, so cannot use Stripe)</p>
