<p>I read about the Pomodoro Technique on the org mode mailing list. I
have decided to try it out and have noticed a definite gain in
productivity.</p>

<p>I naturally take breaks such as browsing the web or chatting...  The
pomodoro mode gives me a precise slice of time for such breaks. I am
always surprised how quickly a five minutes break just flies by. The
other gain is that I am tracking my time better.</p>

<p>Since I use it so much I decided to write <a href="pomodoro.el">write code</a> to integrate it
with emacs.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="pomodoro.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In the screen shot above the modeline indicates that I am on my second
set of work. The number indicates I have 22 minutes left and it
decreases each minute. The pomodoro buffer pops up in between break
and work.  At that time the emacs windows will be raised in front
so that I don't miss it when I am working outside emacs.</p>
