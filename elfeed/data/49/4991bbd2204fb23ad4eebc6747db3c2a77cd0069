<p>What I think is wonderful in my trade is that I can program the tools
that I work with. I am trying to be as productive as possible. However
when I add something to be more efficient I still use the old way.
It's muscle memory. Here is how I fix it.</p>

<p>For example, I have made an alias of v to launch vim.</p>

<pre class="src">
<span style="color: #00688b; background-color: #b9babd;">alias</span> <span style="color: #000000; background-color: #b9babd;">v</span>=vi.sh
<span style="color: #00688b; background-color: #b9babd;">bindkey</span> -s vi <span style="color: #8b5a00; background-color: #b9babd;">"type v instead"</span>
</pre>

<p>The second line will help me get out of the habit of typing vi. When I
type vi, it will say to type v instead. The nice thing is zsh will
show me the message before I hit return.</p>

<p>In zsh typing 'cd' is not necessary to move into a directory when the
auto_cd option is set. I have typed 'cd' for the last 20 years so
there was only one way to improve:</p>

<pre class="src">
<span style="color: #00688b; background-color: #b9babd;">setopt</span> auto_cd
<span style="color: #00688b; background-color: #b9babd;">bindkey</span> -s cd <span style="color: #8b5a00; background-color: #b9babd;">'Not needed in zsh'</span>
</pre>
