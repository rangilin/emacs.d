<p>A couple of months ago I wrote an <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/multiMobile">infodeck about developing mobile
applications for multiple devices</a>. A core point of the deck is that
for the best user-experience you need several native applications, but this
is expensive. To reduce cost a mobile web application works on all
suitable devices, but a web-app limits your user-interface. The result
is an unavoidable choice between user-experience and cost.</p>

<p>While we can’t make that trade-off go away, we can turn a binary
choice into a more graduated scale by developing hybrid applications
that mix web and native technologies. At ThoughtWorks we’ve been
pursuing this path on various client projects, with some success.
We’ve now developed enough understanding on how to approach a hybrid
application to make it worth sharing some code, so we recently
released Calatrava, which is a framework to enable this web-native
interoperation.</p>

<p>Calatrava is suitable for applications with significant client-side
domain logic and when the application a channel for your product
rather than the product itself. It is not suitable if most of your
code is UI code (such as a game) or if a web app provides a
sufficiently good user-experience. Calatrava is probably most valuable
when you want to pursue an incremental release strategy, such as
