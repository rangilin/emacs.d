While the official elisp reference does contain some style tips, it's
hard to deny that the community needed a more comprehensive and (at
the same time) concise style guide. Mostly, new Emacs developers have
been left to learn the ropes by reading other source files. As practical
as that might be, it's dangerous in its propensity to propagate bad
habits.

To medicate this, Bozhidar Batsov, whose <a href="http://emacsredux.com/">blog</a> I'm sure you follow,
puts up a community-driven <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-lisp-style-guide">style guide</a> for Emacs lisp.
</p>

<p>
If you write any sort of Emacs package, make sure you pay it a visit
and see if you can think of anything that's missing. I'm doing my part
over there, let's get that plane off the ground.
