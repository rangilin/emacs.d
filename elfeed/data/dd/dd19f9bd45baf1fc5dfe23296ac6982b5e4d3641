<p>It was a bad idea to install <code>Gnome</code> 2.6 on my machine: my system is
quite unstable.The edit box in <code>Mozilla</code> doesn't work and <code>Gnomemeeting</code>
crashes when I receive a call.</p>

<p>Well it is Debian &quot;unstable&quot;, isn't it? I have stored my list of
packages before doing the Gnome thing so I can revert to how things
were.</p>

<p><code>dpkg --get-selections &gt; before-gnome</code></p>

<p>I have formatted my Windows partition by accident so I guess
I'll have to reinstall it. Some days everything goes wrong and this
is the day</p>
