<p>After I finished <a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring</a>, I created a small web site at <a href="http://refactoring.com">refactoring.com</a> to act as an online summary of the refactorings in the book. It’s mainstay is a <a href="http://refactoring.com/catalog/">catalog</a> which provides a brief summary of each refactoring. I built it around 2000 and until today it still was very much a product of the late 90’s. Over the last few weeks I’ve changed its appearance, made a more dynamic catalog page with some interactive filters, redrawn the diagrams, and added some deep links to the relevant pages of <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/0-201-485672/ch06lev1sec1">Safari Books Online</a>. I’ve also added links and refactorings from the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoringRubyEd.html">ruby edition</a> of the book.</p>
