I <i>think</i> I'm blogging again. Certainly the current frequency of posts
would imply I am. And if I'm blogging again, I'm doing it because
there are thoughts that are too public for Facebook &amp; too long for
Twitter. Thoughts like, "<a href="/2011/07/native-apps-vs-web-apps.html">Google's webapps are so good that they show
webapps are doomed.</a>"  And non-technical thoughts too, like, "In the
future, Pelicans will be armed."
