<p>After an amazing showing by the development community, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ibdknox/light-table">Light Table</a> has hit its goal of $200,000 with 20 days left to go! I want to extend my sincerest thanks to all of you who have helped spread the word, and committed to a future of a better tools. It has been an amazing past couple of weeks that has given me a chance to talk to some of the best and brightest in the business. I think as a group of builders we&#39;re ready to finally see our tools work for us and I&#39;m honored that you&#39;ve put your faith in me to do that.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been quiet over the past couple weeks as I&#39;ve been putting together a demo to show the real power of what&#39;s to come and I can&#39;t wait to show it to you all. I&#39;ll give you a little hint: I&#39;ve been making a lot of sssSSSSssssSSssss noises lately ;)</p>
