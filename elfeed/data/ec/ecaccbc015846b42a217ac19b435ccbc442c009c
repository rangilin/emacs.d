<p>I&#8217;m working on a book that should serve the same purpose as this series of screencasts but for an audience that prefers reading rather than watching screencasts.</p>

<p>This whole project is as much for my own education as it is to spread the word. It is also a &#8220;work in progress&#8221;. Once I upload a video, it&#8217;s unlikely that I&#8217;ll &#8220;fix&#8221; any mistakes in it. I&#8217;ll update errata in the blog post but will not redo the video. However, the book will undergo changes repeatedly till I&#8217;m satisfied. I also hope that the quality of the videos will improve over time.</p>

<p>The book is tentatively titles &#8220;Emacs : A programmers editor&#8221; and my plan is to break it down into four parts.</p>

<p>Part 1 will dvelve on basics like terminology, navigation, basic customisation etc. Part 2 on &#8220;applications&#8221; which are things which you can use Emacs for like keeping your diary, editing directories, as a PIM, as a shell etc. Part 3 is going to be where I talk about programmers and things which benefit them. I&#8217;ll dive into a few of the popular major modes and also into things like version control integration etc. Finally, part 4 is going to focus on elisp and how to make Emacs do your bidding.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t finalised where and how I&#8217;m going to release or put up the book. Right now, my plan is to put the book in the <a href="http://emacsmovies.org/book">/book</a> subdirectory with some kind of an index but this is tentative so don&#8217;t rely on the URLs being permanent.</p>

<p>With that, <a href="http://emacsmovies.org/book/10_intro-chapter.html">here</a> is the introductory chapter.</p>

<p>Feedback is welcome and you can email me at <a href="mailto:noufal@emacsmovies.org">noufal@emacsmovies.org</a>.</p>
