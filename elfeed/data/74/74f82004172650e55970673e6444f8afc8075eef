Hello, folks, and welcome to my new blog! In many ways, this is a continuation of my former work over at http://anarchycreek.com, which you should take a gander at if you want to know where I&#8217;m heading. This blog is about three topics, usually intermingled herein; Programmers &#8212; People who create software for a living. [&#8230;]
