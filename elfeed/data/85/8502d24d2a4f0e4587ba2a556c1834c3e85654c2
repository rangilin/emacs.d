<p>My tip for today if you do move files from one partition to another
and that you find out you do no have enough space. Do not, I repeat,
do not copy the files back to their original destination. Indeed it
seems that the <code>mv</code> command will create empty files if the destination
is full. If you copy your files back you will clobber your original
files with empty ones!</p>
