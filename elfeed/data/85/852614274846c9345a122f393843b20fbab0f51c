<p>My e-mail address shown on my contact page is getting more and more
spam. I will change it soon, beware!</p>

<p>I am again annoyed as I can't listen to the BBC anymore. This has
worked for years with the venerable Real Player 8 for Linux. It seems
that BBC has upgraded their servers and it just won't work anymore.</p>

<p>So I tried the Real Player One alpha without much luck. I couldn't see
any Mozilla plugin in their package.</p>

<p>I then signed in to the Helix Communitypage so that I could try the
Helix Player MS2.  I got some assertion error: that's progress! Well
I'll try to build the darn thing and see if I can make it work....</p>

<p>Had a kick to see that my friend Nick is the
tech lead for the Unix player. Keep up the good work Nick!</p>
