<p>Next week I’m heading off to spend some time in Australia (thankfully
away from all this snow-shovelling). While I’m there I’ll be
participating in a series of <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/events/thoughtworks-quarterly-briefing-continuous-delivery">Quarterly Technology Briefings</a>. These
will take the form of a panel Q&amp;A on <a href="http://martinfowler.com/delivery.html">Continuous Delivery</a>. On the
panel I shall be over-shadowed by <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">Neal Ford</a> and we will both be
over-shadowed by <a href="http://evan.bottch.com/">Evan Bottcher</a>.</p>
