This discussion looked at the downsides of testing and TDD: can you do too much testing, and is there a problem with teams valuing tests more than they value the functional code? We’ve set the time for <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cco30ri6dpkej4h4d8mejmat98o">our fifth and final hangout</a> to be on Wednesday June 4th at 1100 Eastern time. This one will be a Q&amp;A - to submit and vote on questions go to the <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cco30ri6dpkej4h4d8mejmat98o">event page</a> and press the play button. We’ll also do some final thoughts and wrap up, which will make this discussion run longer than we’ve done so far (maybe going up to an hour). </p>

<p>ThoughtWorks has also put audio for all the episodes onto its newly relaunched <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/thoughtworks/id881136697?mt=2">podcast feed</a>.</p>
