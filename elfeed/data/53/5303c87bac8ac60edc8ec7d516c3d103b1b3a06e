<p>Next month I’ll be spending a chunk of time in Europe. I have two
talks lined up. Firstly I’ll be turning up in Aarhus at <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/">my favorite conference</a>
where I’ll be kicking off the NoSQL track on October 3rd with <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/presentation/Introduction%20to%20NoSQL">an introduction to
NoSQL</a> - roughly based on material from <a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/nosql.html">NoSQL Distilled</a>. </p>

<p>Then, on October 4, I’ll be <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/events/martin-fowler-jez-humble-berlin">speaking in Berlin at a ThoughtWorks event</a>
with <a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/">Jez Humble</a>. For that I’ll do one of my usual <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html">Suites of Talks</a>.
There will be some NoSQL in the suite, but probably mixed with some
other material too. </p>
