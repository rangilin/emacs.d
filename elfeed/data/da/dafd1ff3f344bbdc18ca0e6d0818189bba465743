A common annoyance with Emacs when working on a code base that has duplicate file names is that the mode line tends to display the buffer names as “one.py:&lt;1&gt;”, “one.py:&lt;2&gt;” etc etc. That doesn’t help much with telling them apart and I find it confusing. I was introduced to the Uniquify library a while ago. <a class="read-more" href="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/2014/08/unique-buffer-names-in-emacs/">[…]</a>
