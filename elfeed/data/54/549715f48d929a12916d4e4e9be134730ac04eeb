<p>Thanks to <a href="http://lynn.io/">Lynn Wallenstein</a>, I have a new web site design. If you see problems with the layout, it&#8217;s almost definitely because I screwed something up after Lynn gave me the code. Sorry, Lynn. :(</p>

<p>I have also used this as a chance to move from my own server (which I&#8217;ve been screwing with for over a decade) to Octopress hosted on Github Pages. I&#8217;m glad to be done with that phase of my life.</p>

<p>Anyway, with Octopress I feel like I&#8217;m stepping back to the simple, productive environment I had ten years ago with <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rublog/">Rublog</a>.</p>
