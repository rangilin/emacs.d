<p>I've switched my Git repositories to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> recently,
and started to watch my contributions statistics, which were very low
considering I spend my days hacking on open source software, especially
<a href="https://openstack.org">OpenStack</a>.</p>

<p>OpenStack hosts its Git repositories on its own infrastructure at
<a href="http://git.openstack.org">git.openstack.org</a>, but also mirrors them on
GitHub. Logically, I was expecting GitHub to track my commits there too, as
I'm using the same email address everywhere.</p>
<p>It turns out that it was not the case, and the
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile">help page about that</a>
on GitHub describes the rule in place to compute statistics. Indeed,
according to GitHub, I had no relations to the OpenStack repositories, as I
never forked them nor opened a pull request on them (OpenStack uses
<a href="http://review.openstack.org">Gerrit</a>).</p>
<p>Starring a repository is enough to build a relationship between a user and a
repository, so this is was the only thing needed to inform GitHub that I
have contributed to those repositories. Considering OpenStack has hundreds
of repositories, I decided to star them all by using a small Python script
using <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygithub">pygithub</a>.</p>

<p>And voil√†, <a href="https://github.com/jd">my statistics</a> are now including all my
contributions to OpenStack!</p>
