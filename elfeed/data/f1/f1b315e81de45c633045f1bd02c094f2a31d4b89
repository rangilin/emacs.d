<p>I recently deleted a note on my Notes app on my apple laptop. As someone who is a paranoid keeper of backups, and usually commits all my work to a repository like git, I don’t worry much about accidental deletion. But Apple’s notes app doesn’t have any form of version control, and it’s all too easy to delete something by accident. I have a daily rsync backup and run time machine, but googling couldn’t uncover a simple way of getting the note back. So in case someone else needs to do this, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/apple-notes-restore.html">here’s what I did</a>.</p>
