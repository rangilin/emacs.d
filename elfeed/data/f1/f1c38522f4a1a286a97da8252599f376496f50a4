<p>Next month (June 7) I’ll be speaking at a ThoughtWorks Quarterly briefing in
Singapore. I’ll be doing a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html">suite of talks</a>, one of which I
expect will be NoSQL-oriented. Also on the bill is Vivek Prahlad, a
long-term colleague at ThoughtWorks, who I’m looking forward to
catching up with. This will be the my first time in Singapore
(other than the airport).</p>

<p>I’m then going on to talks in China: Chengdu, Wuhan, and Xi’an. </p>
