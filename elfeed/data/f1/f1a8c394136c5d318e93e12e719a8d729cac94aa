<p>I’ve been very tardy in doing this, but I’ve finally put up a set of
reference pages for the patterns in the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/dsl.html">DSL Book</a>. There’s not much
on each page, just the intent, chapter reference, and sometimes some
summary text. I’ve primarily put these up to give them a stable URI
for reference purposes. There’s a chance I’ll put supplemental
material up there too, but I’ve had that intention before without
anything happening. </p>
