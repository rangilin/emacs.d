<p>I’m going to Germany next week and we’ve added a third speaking event
to my trip. As well as speaking at <a href="http://www.sigs-datacom.de/oop2011/oop2011-eng/latest-news.html">OOP</a> in Munich and in <a href="http://jugcologne.eu/">Cologne</a>,
ThoughtWorks has organized a <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/events/software-design-21st-century-deutschland">speaking event in Hamburg</a> on Jan
31st. My colleagues Erik Döernenburg and Wolf Schlegel will give a
talk on Continuous Deployment and I’ll follow with my usual
