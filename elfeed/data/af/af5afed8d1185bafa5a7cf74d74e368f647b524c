My copy arrived a day or two ago, and it’s good to see it in paper.
Amazon has it available for order for physical copy. Currently they
aren’t showing it as available for Kindle, but that should change in
the next few days. InformIT is still showing a pre-order status, but
again that should change soon.</p>

<p>It also seems I made a mistake earlier with the page count, which actually is
only 152 pages. So we only busted our budget by two pages after all.</p>

<p>(I’ve updated my <a href="http://martinfowler.com/books">books pages</a> to add a new page for this book.)</p>
