<p>Okay, this is a bad idea if your files are prefixed with <code>~</code>.</p>

<hr/>

<pre class="code-snippet">
(add-hook 'ido-setup-hook
 (<span class="keyword">lambda</span> ()
   <span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">Go straight home
</span>   (define-key ido-file-completion-map
     (kbd <span class="string">"~"</span>)
     (<span class="keyword">lambda</span> ()
       (interactive)
       (<span class="keyword">if</span> (looking-back <span class="string">"/"</span>)
           (insert <span class="string">"~/"</span>)
         (call-interactively 'self-insert-command))))))</pre>

<p>
  But if they're not, this keybinding lets you even more quickly reach
  your home folder when in ido-find-file.
</p>

<p>
  It doesn't matter if you're a million directories in, just
  press <kbd>~</kbd> to go home.
