<p>For some reason searching the Internet didn't me help much. So here
are the steps to verify the integrity of a file you have downloaded on
the Internet.</p>

<pre class="example">
      gpg --verify-files emacs-24.3.tar.gz.sig
gpg: Signature made Mon Mar 11 03:04:35 2013 CET using RSA key ID A0B0F199
gpg: Can't check signature: No public key
</pre>

<p>This means you need to import the public key A0B0F199.</p>

<pre class="example">
      gpg --recv-keys A0B0F199
gpg: requesting key A0B0F199 from hkp server keys.gnupg.net
gpg: key A0B0F199: public key &quot;Glenn Morris &lt;rgm@gnu.org&gt;&quot; imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
</pre>

<p>Now that you have received the public key, you can verify the file.</p>

<pre class="example">
      gpg --verify-files emacs-24.3.tar.gz.sig
gpg: Signature made Mon Mar 11 03:04:35 2013 CET using RSA key ID A0B0F199
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Glenn Morris &lt;rgm@gnu.org&gt;&quot;
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: B294 26DE FB07 724C 3C35  E5D3 6592 E9A3 A0B0 F199
</pre>

<p>The file is good. The warning just means you haven't met Glenn in
person for a key exchange. It is very unlikely that the file you have
downloaded is infected.</p>
