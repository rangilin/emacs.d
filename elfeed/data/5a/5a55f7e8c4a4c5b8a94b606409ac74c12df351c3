<p>We are now pleased to announce our ability to reopen course access to residents of Sudan and Cuba. Coursera recently received a license from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury to secure permission and reinstate course access in these countries.</p>

<p>Similarly to the OFAC General License for Iran, export control regulations still prohibit us from offering certain advanced STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) subjects. To comply, we will be blocking enrollment for those specific courses to learners coming from  IP addresses originating in Iran, Sudan, and Cuba. However, the vast majority of our courses will now be open to learners everywhere. For more guidance on accessibility or questions, please find an update in our <a href="http://help.coursera.org/customer/portal/articles/1425714" target="_blank">Student Support Center</a></p>

<p>We thank you for your patience as we strive to bring free accessible education to people around the world. </p>
