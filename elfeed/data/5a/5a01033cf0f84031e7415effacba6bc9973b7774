<p>I have used bash for over ten years. I just got a little curious and
decided to study the competitor zsh.</p>

<p>I think it has a killer feature: shared history. The previous commands
will be shared between instance of zsh. I find this very handy since I
always run several shell with scree. The following lines turn it on:</p>

<pre class="example">
# History sharing and huge size
HISTSIZE=10000
SAVEHIST=10000
HISTFILE=~/.history
setopt share_history
setopt append_history
</pre>

<p>I am not sure I will switch to zsh but it's interesting to change
things a bit.</p>
