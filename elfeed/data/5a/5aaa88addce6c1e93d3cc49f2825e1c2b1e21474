<p>So, I wrote a book called <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/4rulesofsimpledesign">Understanding the 4 Rules of Simple Design</a></em>! Huzzah! It has been a long time coming, for sure. Here&#39;s a bit more information about it, as well as some feedback from readers. I&#39;ve also created a <a href="http://samples.leanpub.com/4rulesofsimpledesign-sample.pdf">free downloadable sample</a> to get a taste of it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m <strong>donating 10% of the profits</strong> to support kids-oriented programming events. I already have funds earmarked to support a local <a href="http://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a> program here in Chicago.</p>

<p>The only thing we truly know about the act of building software is that we are going to be faced with change. It is inevitable. As we gain more knowledge about our domain and our use cases, we will have to change our software. This book is about how to survive in the face of this fact.</p>

<p>At coderetreat workshops, we focus on practicing fundamental software development techniques, such as test-driven development, iterative design and pair-programming. Over the past five years of facilitating these workshops, I&#39;ve come to a realization that simple design, the idea of writing maintainable code that facilitates the inevitable change, is the key. The <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?XpSimplicityRules">4 Rules of Simple Design</a>, originally codified by Kent Beck in the late 90s, are a fantastic starting point to building flexible codebases.</p>

<p>In <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/4rulesofsimpledesign">Understanding the 4 Rules of Simple Design</a></em>, we look at small, focused examples of applying these rules. While the backdrop is Conway&#39;s Game of Life (the domain used at coderetreat workshops), you won&#39;t need any background in it. Never been to a coderetreat? That isn&#39;t a problem either, I don&#39;t make any assumptions that you have.</p>

<p>On the fence? Check out some of the early feedback from the book. </p>

<p>Bart Bakker wrote a <a href="http://blog.thesoftwarecraft.com/2014/04/book-review-understanding-4-rules-of.html">great review with personal thoughts on it</a>.</p>

<p>Richard Dalton wrote a nice <a href="http://www.devjoy.com/2014/04/understanding-the-four-rules-of-simple-design/">review of <em>Understanding the 4 Rules of Simple Design</em></a>.</p>

<p>Ian Whitney, after reading the book, wrote a post about experimenting with the idea of <a href="http://programming.ianwhitney.com/blog/2014/04/13/4-simple-rules-and-declarative-builders/">using declarative builder methods instead of the default initializer</a>.</p>

<p>Erik Olsen, a beginner developer out of Dev Bootcamp, wrote about <a href="http://erikolsen-dev.tumblr.com/post/82618138712/understanding-the-four-rules-of-simple-design">his thoughts after reading it</a>.</p>
