<p>Setting up Amanda client on Mandrake. A word for the wise:
forget about the rpm package! It doesn't have the service that the
server expects: amandad.</p>

<p>The quickest way to make it work is to grab the source from
the Amanda web page. Compile and install the client part.</p>

<pre class="example">
./configure --without-server --with-user=backup --with-group=backup
make
make install
</pre>

<p>Next create and add the following lines in the file <code>/etc/xinet.d/amanda</code>:</p>

<pre class="example">
service amanda
{
    socket_type = dgram
    protocol = udp
    wait = yes
    user = backup
    server  = /usr/local/libexec/amandad
}
</pre>

<p>Run <code>amcheck</code> on the server to check that the
client is set up properly. You should be set!</p>
