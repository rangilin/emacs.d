<p>I have been using the Pomodoro Technique for about a year now. The
concept is very simple. I work for 25 minutes and then take a break of
5 minute. After 4 sets I take a long break of 15 minutes. I feel more
productive as taking breaks is good for my brain. I also feel less
tired after a long day at work</p>
