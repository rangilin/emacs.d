<p>Sometime you will end up with a lot of files to resolve and you know
you want your changes and squash upstream changes. It's very easy to do
but not very well documented:</p>

<pre class="example">
git checkout --ours file.txt
git add file.txt
</pre>

<p>The add command marks the conflict as resolved. Instead of a file you
can pass a directory, that way you can resolve the content of the
directory. There is the &mdash;theirs option that does the opposite, ie.
squash you changes and use upstream.</p>
