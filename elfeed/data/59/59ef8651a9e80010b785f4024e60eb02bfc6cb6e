<p>
  The <code>saveplace</code> package is part of Emacs, and remembers the
  position of point - even between emacs sessions.
</p>

<p>
  The last line sets the path to where saveplace stores your position
  data. Change it at your peril! <small>*</small>

<p>
  <small>* Ahem, there really is no peril. That was just melodrama.</small>
