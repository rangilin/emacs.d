<p>The future is going to be different. What each of us knows now will not be enough to address future changes and challenges. How you will solve those problems will involve a lot more than by just having more information; you will need to be creative.</p>

As a learner, you’ll get promoted to change your own life and habits through a series of challenges, each ending with a different twist. Assessment of these assignments are also designed to help you be more creative; you see the work of others and come up with ideas to improve their work. </p>

<p>Since the first time the class ran in February 2014, learners have gotten new jobs, promotions and some even found a great way to think of something new for dinner. Remember, your level of creativity is not fixed and it can be developed and improved. </p>
