I gave two short talks (about 25 minutes each), both of which are now available on YouTube. The first talk looks at the topic of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqEg37e4Mkw">Workflows of Refactoring</a>, where I explore various ways in which people can (but often donâ€™t) use refactoring in their work. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8aECe4lp44">second talk</a> I begin with my concern about the biggest aspect missing from the spread of agile and go on to explore the relationship between programmers, analysts, users and the wider society. (I have a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/tags/talk%20videos.html">list of all videos of my talks</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJb2p0qX8R_r3crCVAxp57dvoqGGjD3yD">YouTube playlist</a> for those on YouTube.)</p>
