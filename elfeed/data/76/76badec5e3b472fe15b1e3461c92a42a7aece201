  <p>
    When we <a href="http://blog.golang.org/go-and-google-app-engine" target="_blank">launched Go for App Engine</a>


    in May 2011 the SDK was just a modified version of the Python SDK.


    At the time, there was no canonical way to build or organize Go programs, so it


    made sense to take the Python approach. Since then Go 1.0 was released,


    including the <a href="http://golang.org/cmd/go/" target="_blank">go tool</a> and a


    <a href="http://golang.org/doc/code.html" target="_blank">convention</a> for organizing Go programs.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    In January 2013 we announced


    <a href="http://blog.golang.org/the-app-engine-sdk-and-workspaces-gopath" target="_blank">better integration</a>


    between the Go App Engine SDK and the go tool, promoting the use of


    conventional import paths in App Engine apps and making it possible to use &#34;go


    get&#34; to fetch app dependencies.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    With the recent release of App Engine 1.8.8 we are pleased to announce more


    improvements to the developer experience for Go on App Engine.
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_2.">The goapp tool</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    The Go App Engine SDK now includes the &#34;goapp&#34; tool, an App Engine-specific


    version of the &#34;go&#34; tool. The new name permits users to keep both the regular


    &#34;go&#34; tool and the &#34;goapp&#34; tool in their system PATH.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    In addition to the existing &#34;go&#34; tool <a href="http://golang.org/cmd/go/" target="_blank">commands</a>,


    the &#34;goapp&#34; tool provides new commands for working with App Engine apps.


    The &#34;<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/tools/devserver" target="_blank">goapp serve</a>&#34;


    command starts the local development server and the


    &#34;<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/tools/uploadinganapp" target="_blank">goapp deploy</a>&#34;


    command uploads an app to App Engine.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    The main advantages offered by the &#34;goapp serve&#34; and &#34;goapp deploy&#34; commands


    are a simplified user interface and consistency with existing commands like


    &#34;go get&#34; and &#34;go fmt&#34;.


    For example, to run a local instance of the app in the current directory, run:
  </p>
  

  
  <div class="code"><pre>$ goapp serve</pre></div>
  

  
  <p>
    To upload it to App Engine:
  </p>
  

  
  <div class="code"><pre>$ goapp deploy</pre></div>
  

  
  <p>
    You can also specify the Go import path to serve or deploy:
  </p>
  

  
  <div class="code"><pre>$ goapp serve github.com/user/myapp</pre></div>
  

  
  <p>
    You can even specify a YAML file to serve or deploy a specific


    <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/modules/" target="_blank">module</a>:
  </p>
  

  
  <div class="code"><pre>$ goapp deploy mymodule.yaml</pre></div>
  

  
  <p>
    These commands can replace most uses of <code>dev_appserver.py</code> and <code>appcfg.py</code>,


    although the Python tools are still available for their less common uses.
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_3.">Local unit testing</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    The Go App Engine SDK now supports local unit testing, using Go&#39;s native


    <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/tools/localunittesting" target="_blank">testing package</a>


    and the &#34;<a href="http://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Test_packages" target="_blank">go test</a>&#34; command


    (provided as &#34;goapp test&#34; by the SDK).
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Furthermore, you can now write tests that use App Engine services.


    The <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/tools/localunittesting#Go_Introducing_the_aetest_package" target="_blank">aetest package</a>


    provides an appengine.Context value that delegates requests to a temporary


    instance of the development server.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    For more information about using &#34;goapp test&#34; and the aetest package, see the


    <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/tools/localunittesting" target="_blank">Local Unit Testing for Go documentation</a>.


    Note that the aetest package is still in its early days;


    we hope to add more features over time.
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_4.">Better concurrency support</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    It is now possible to configure the number of concurrent requests served by


    each of your app&#39;s dynamic instances by setting the


    <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/modules/#max_concurrent_requests" target="_blank"><code>max_concurrent_requests</code></a> option


    (available to <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/modules/#automatic_scaling" target="_blank">Automatic Scaling modules</a> only).
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Here&#39;s an example <code>app.yaml</code> file:
  </p>
  

  
  <div class="code"><pre>application: maxigopher
version: 1
runtime: go
api_version: go1
automatic_scaling:
  max_concurrent_requests: 100</pre></div>
  

  
  <p>
    This configures each instance of the app to serve up to 100 requests


    concurrently (up from the default of 10). You can configure Go instances to


    serve up to a maximum of 500 concurrent requests.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    This setting allows your instances to handle more simultaneous requests by


    taking advantage of Go&#39;s efficient handling of concurrency, which should yield


    better instance utilization and ultimately fewer billable instance hours.
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_5.">Conclusion</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    With these changes Go on App Engine is more convenient and efficient than ever,


    and we hope you enjoy the improvements. Please join the
