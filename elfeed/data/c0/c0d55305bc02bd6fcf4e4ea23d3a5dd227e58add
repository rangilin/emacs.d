<p>Securing funding for OS projects and blogs (outside of displaying annoying ads)
is a hard endeavor.  While I&#8217;d love to raise enough cash to work on
CIDER, projectile and Emacs itself for an entire year through some
wildly successful crowdfunding campaign, that&#8217;s unlikely to ever
happen.</p>

<p>That said, I recently discovered an interesting alternative to one-off
crowdfunding campaigns called <a href="http://gittip.com">gittip</a>.
Self-described as <code>sustainable crowdfunding</code> (meaning people will get
microdonations (say half a buck) from their patrons each week) it seems like a
reasonable way to raise a modest sum of money so you could work on
open-source projects more than your regular schedule might permit.</p>

<p>So, if you like Emacs Redux and the Emacs projects in which I&#8217;m involved like:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Prelude</a> - An Emacs distribution built on top of GNU Emacs 24</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a> - Project Interaction Library for Emacs, that stays out of your way</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode">clojure-mode</a> - A major mode for programming in Clojure</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">cider</a> - A Clojure programming environment for Emacs</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/guru-mode">guru-mode</a> - An annoying companion on your journey to Emacs mastery</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">rubocop-emacs</a> - Emacs integration for <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">RuboCop</a></li>
