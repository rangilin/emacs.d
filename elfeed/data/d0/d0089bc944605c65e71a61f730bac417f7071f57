Karl Scotland introduces the Kanban Canvas â€“ a sheet he has designed to be printed on A0 paper and used to collaboratively explore a kanban system.  The canvas is built around the heuristics and related questions, with the goal being to co-create a system design by exploring and answering the questions.  The Kanban Canvas can be downloaded <a href="http://kanban-thinking.net/">here</a> <i>By Karl Scotland</i>
