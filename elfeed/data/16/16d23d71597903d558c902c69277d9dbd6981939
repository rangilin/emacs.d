<p>We had an interesting discussion<a href="http://osherove.com/trainingoptions"> in class </a>on how one can detect you might be in survival mode. Here are some possible early warning signs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a perception or feeling of continuous urgency</li>
<li>There is lack of context (why are we doing this? where are we heading? When is this expected? what are the expectations?)</li>
<li>The team is forced into a state where they are always <em>reacting</em>&nbsp;to changes (key word here is <em>forced</em>&nbsp;because a self organizing team can choose to simply react with changes such as during &nbsp;a continuous delivery flow). Not being able to choose whether to plan some things out.</li>
<li>There is no time to reduce risk (technical debt, bus factors etc)</li>
<li>The team is unable to deliver</li>
<li>There is only time to take shortcuts</li>
<li>A long period of stress</li>
<li>Being non productive for a long period of time</li>
</ol>
