<p>ThoughtWorks is joining with several organizations, including the EFF, Reddit, Mozilla, and Demand Progress in a call to the international community to fight against mass surveillance. If you are concerned about the growth of mass surveillance of our internet communications, I urge you to see how you can take part. On February 11th, many websites will be adding banners to their site encouraging people to make their opinions known, particularly those in the U.S. concerned about how our government is indulging in behavior that can lead to undermining democracy. </p>

For more background on the rationale behind this day of action, read <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/01/february-11-day-we-fight-back-calling-international-community">this statement from the EFF</a>.
