<p>I think org mode is a good enough reason to use emacs. Of course there
are many others but I won't delve into it for this article. For those
who don't know org mode is an outliner on steroids. It's using plain
text file so you can view you're data with any text editor. GTD is an
acronym for Getting Things Done by David Allen.</p>

<p>When I started with org mode I was using tags, workflows, priorities,
checklists, etc... It's wonderful stuff however I have stopped using
them as I don't I feel it's needed for my use of GTD. Some may feel
the tags are important to give context. I am almost always in front of
a computer so this information is not very important for me.</p>

<p>I am currently using six org files:</p>

<ul>
<li>work.org for work actions</li>
<li>perso.org for personal actions</li>
<li>kb.org for knowledge base</li>
<li>calendar.org self explanatory, I put habits in there too</li>
<li>keyring.gpg crypted org for passwords and what not</li>
<li>drill.org implements org-drill for studying Japanese, etc..</li>
</ul>

<p>I use to have all my action in one file. I was following David Allen's
idea that all actions are work. I am lucky to work four days out of
five and so I picked my 'off' day to do my weekly review. As I said
before it didn't feel right to do work stuff at home so I am doing two
weekly review: a personal one on Thursday and professional on Friday.</p>

<p>My action org file are outlined as such:</p>
