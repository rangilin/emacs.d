<p>If you&#39;ve been around the programming community long enough then no doubt you
have heard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Impostor Syndrome</a>
mentioned at least a few times. I think that with the backgrounds and qualities
and  many programmers have combined with the almost guaranteed success (crap,
is that my impostor syndrome kicking up?) of being a programmer it is clear why
it is so rampant in our circles.</p>

<h3>What is Impostor Syndrome?</h3>

<p>Simply put, impostor syndrome is when a person isn&#39;t believing of their
competence despite vast amounts of evidence that such competence does exist. It
is more prevalent in certain types of people than others but all-in-all
<strong>nearly 70% of people experience impostor syndrome at one point or another.</strong></p>

<h3>Why Programmers?</h3>

<p>Aside from many of the qualities a lot of programmers have in common I think
the other leading contributor to impostor syndrome is continuous improvement. I
think that continuous improvement is very widespread amongst programmers and
it&#39;s hard to believe in your accomplishments when you already have your eye on
that next area of study.</p>

<p>As a Ruby programmer the number of things I can study are immense. Ruby the
language, Rails the framework, design patterns, Test-driven Development, UNIX,
vim, web technologies -- the list goes on and on. Any feeling of accomplishment
is almost immediately kicked aside with the rolling up of my sleeves as I get
ready to dive into the next topic. Not to mention the feeling of finally
feeling good about your knowledge of something only to stumble upon some other
programmer <em>that</em> much better.</p>

<h3>Let&#39;s Beat This</h3>

<p>I was recently catching up on some <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/">Ruby Rogues</a>
episodes (which is an excellent podcast that I can&#39;t recommend enough) and
listened to one called <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/112-rr-community-hacks/">Community
Hacks</a>. In the episode Josh
Susser gives a quick rant about how important it is that people in the Ruby
community blog and to not be ashamed of the information you&#39;re sharing
regardless of your skill level. </p>

<p>Hearing that from someone like Josh is extremely comforting because I can&#39;t
count the number of times I talk myself out of blogging due to feeling like
someone has already said what I&#39;m going to say and possibly already said it
better. He then goes on to say that highly skilled bloggers even enjoy reading
these blogs because they find things they forgot or stir up memories of
revelations they once had themselves.</p>

<p>The crazy part about all of this is that the best way to overcome impostor
syndrome is to do just that: <strong>write</strong>. To put your competence out there in
hard proof for yourself and everyone to see.</p>

<p>This is my first foot forward at doing so and I hope you&#39;ll do the same.</p>
