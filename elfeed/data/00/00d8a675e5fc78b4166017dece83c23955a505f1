<p>We have now released the latest version of the ThoughtWorks Technology
Radar. This is where a bunch of my colleagues get together and discuss
the technologies that they think are worth keeping an eye on. It’s not
intended to be some comprehensively researched list, as it’s just the
aggregation of the opinions of the small group of people that create
it. But since that group is an experienced group of ThoughtWorks
consultants, I think it’s a useful pointer to things to pay attention
to in enterprise software.</p>
