<p>Just a few moments ago our <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ibdknox/light-table">Kickstarter campaign</a> closed with a truly amazing 7,317 backers at $316,720. It&#39;s been such a whirlwind story over the past 45 days from a simple blog post to what is now a funded startup, a successful kickstarter campaign, and a seat at <a href="http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/05/17/light-table-is-in-yc/">the YC table</a>.</p>

<p>None of that would have been possible without the faith and dedication of all of you. For your support, I give you my sincerest thanks. Now it&#39;s up to us to deliver the future we&#39;ve envisioned. I hope you&#39;re as excited as we are. It&#39;s going to be a wild ride.</p>
