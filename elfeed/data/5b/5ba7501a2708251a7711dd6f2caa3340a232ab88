In this episode we answered questions that viewers submitted via the Google Q&amp;A system. We discussed the dearth of real open-source examples of applications and how this made it harder to examine these questions. We looked at our experiences with TDD and the different kinds of value we’ve drawn from it. We also examined the value of TDD to less experienced developers. We finished by looking at TDD’s place in software development.</p>
