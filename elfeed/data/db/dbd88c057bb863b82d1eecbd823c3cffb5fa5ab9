<p>While catching up on news with newsticker Emacs was flickering and it
was driving me mad. It dawned on me that it was a timer event
overdoing display refresh. It's easy to find out the culprit. First
look at the variable timer-list.</p>

<p>You will get a list looking like this:</p>

<pre class="src">
([nil 20478 31448 437738 60 ac-clear-variables-every-minute nil nil]
 [nil 20478 31452 0 60 display-time-event-handler nil nil]
 [nil 20478 31452 0 60 appt-check nil nil])
</pre>

<p>Now all you need to do is define each timer functions to do nothing by
evaluating:</p>

<pre class="src">
(<span style="color: #8b008b; background-color: #b9babd;">defun</span> <span style="color: #00008b; background-color: #b9babd;">ac-clear-variables-every-minute</span> ())
</pre>

<p>Do this for each functions listed in the timer variable list and
you'll find the function that causes the flicker. Now you can fix it
by either removing the function, improving it or calling it less
often.</p>
