<p>This little known utilities grabs package on demand. Set up the
following alias on your shell:</p>

<pre class="example">
alias auto='auto-apt -y run'
</pre>

<p>You'll need to have <code>sudo</code> to give you root access without a
password. Next time you compile a package from source just do the
following:</p>

<pre class="example">
auto
./configure
</pre>

<p>All the dependencies will be downloaded automatically. Wonderful!  It
just make me grin every time I do it.</p>
