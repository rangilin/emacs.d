<p>
  Undo in region is one of those mind-blowing things about emacs.
  However, the region keeps jumping about when I use it. So I added this:
</p>

<hr/>

<pre class="code-snippet">
<span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">Keep region when undoing in region
</span>(<span class="keyword">defadvice</span> <span class="function-name">undo-tree-undo</span> (around keep-region activate)
  (<span class="keyword">if</span> (use-region-p)
      (<span class="keyword">let</span> ((m (set-marker (make-marker) (mark)))
            (p (set-marker (make-marker) (point))))
        ad-do-it
        (goto-char p)
        (set-mark m)
        (set-marker p nil)
        (set-marker m nil))
    ad-do-it))</pre>

<hr/>

<p>Now the region stays in place while I'm undoing.</p>

<p>
  Since I use undo-tree, that's what it advises, but I would guess it
  works the same for regular old undo too.
