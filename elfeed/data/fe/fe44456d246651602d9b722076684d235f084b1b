In this infodeck, I explore various workflows you can use to integrate refactoring into your programming work - helped by using the “Two Hats” metaphor. These include TDD Refactoring, Litter-Pickup Refactoring, Comprehension Refactoring, Preparatory Refactoring, Planned Refactoring, and Long-Term Refactoring. While not any kind of exhaustive taxonomy, I hope they’ll give teams ideas on how they can extend the use of refactoring to improve their delivery speed.</p>
