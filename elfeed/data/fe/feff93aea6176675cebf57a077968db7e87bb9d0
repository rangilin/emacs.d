<p>This error could be that your certificate is badly formatted. However
in my case it was due to my private key being password protected. It
is easy to fix, the following commands strip the password:</p>

<pre class="example">
copy server.key server.key.orig
openssl rsa -in server.key.orig -out server.key
</pre>
