<p>I’ve long been a fan of the podcast series <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/">Software Engineering
Radio</a>. The team there have built an excellent series of podcasts
on various aspects of software development and I often listen to them
while taking my afternoon walk. So I’m glad to get a spot on there
myself. In this episode I’m on the program with Rebecca Parsons, my
colleague and co-author of my <a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/dsl.html">DSL book</a> to talk about DSLs. We talk
about what DSLs are, the differences between internal and external
DSLs, and when you should (and shouldn’t use DSLs). The episode is
hosted by <a href="http://www.voelter.de/">Markus Völter</a>, who, of course, is a considerable expert on DSLs too
- so it’s really a three way conversation on the topic.</p>
