<p>Last week I was at the <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/">goto conference</a> in Aarhus. Also there was <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott
Hanselman</a>, and wherever Scott goes, he takes his portable recording
studio and his titanium arm-twister. So before long I found myself in
a quiet room with him and Jez Humble to <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/339/continuous-delivery-with-jez-humble-and-martin-fowler">talk about Continuous
Delivery</a>.</p>
