<p>It all started with a post by someone talking about SandS
(Shift and Space) in the org mode mailing list. The idea is that if
you hold the space and type another key you will get a shift instead
of a space.</p>

<p>He pointed to the following <a href="https://gitorious.org/at-home-modifier/pages/Home">site</a>. It's a Xorg extension therefore a
pain to install. I found something much better called <a href="https://github.com/baskerville/keydouble">keydouble</a>, a
simple X application that just works without any fuss.</p>

<p>When I tried mapping the space bar as a control key it didn't work
well because it's a key that I use often. I found myself inserting
control without meaning to.</p>

<p>However I have mapped the ; key to control (it's the key that's
positioned on my right pinky.) It took me a while to unlearn to use
the left control and the left keys all with one hand.</p>

<p>The result was well worth the effort. Issuing commands in emacs has
become much, much easier.</p>

<p>I have hacked <a href="http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/">doublecommand</a> to get the same thing on Mac OSX. E-mail
me if you are interested, It's ugly and hard coded. I would feel
embarrassed to publish it.</p>
