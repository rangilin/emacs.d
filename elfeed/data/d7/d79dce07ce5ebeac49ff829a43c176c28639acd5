<p>I’m hoping to spend more time writing about <a href="/bliki/ExpositionalArchitecture.html">expositional architectures</a>, systems that show interesting  characteristics that will act as seeds for ideas for other software systems. To make a start I’ve written an infodeck describing the <a href="/articles/gap-scms-po">SCMS-PO system of Gap Inc</a>. It’s a system for managing purchase orders with a rich javascript client talking to a java server system using a resource API. Interesting features include using knockout.js form of the Presentation Model pattern, a javascript validator running on both client and server, encapsulating data access with repositories, using MongoDB as an application database, and the testing portfolio. </p>
