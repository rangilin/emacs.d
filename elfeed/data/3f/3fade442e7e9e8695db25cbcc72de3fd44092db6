<p>First you'll need to <a href="http://ipw2100.sourceforge.net/firmware.php">download</a> the firmware in the <code>/tmp</code> directory.</p>

<pre class="example">
# cd /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware
# tar xzf /tmp/ipw2100-fw-1.3.tgz
</pre>

<p>You'll need to locate and dowload the ipw2100-source package. It's
currently in the unstable section.</p>

<pre class="example">
# apt-get install module-assistant wireless-tools
# dpkg -i ipw2100-source_0.56-1_all.deb
# module-assistant prepare
# module-assistant a-i ipw2100
</pre>

<p>Next you'll need to configure you're wireless access. Put the
following stanza in the file <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>:</p>

<pre class="example">
iface eth1 inet dhcp
wireless_essid belkin54g
wireless_key 419e0f8585ffbff42e90df4246
</pre>

<p>Reboot your computer. Start your wireless interface by typing <code>ifup
eth1</code>. If everything went fine you should have a wireless connection.</p>
