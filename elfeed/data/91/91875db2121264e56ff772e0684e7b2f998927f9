<p>My site hasn’t seen any updates for over a month, so I thought I’d
make a quick note of what I’ve been up to. On the whole I’m not
someone who tries to make a regular schedule of site updates - I write
as I have the time, energy, and inspiration to do so. Regular articles
were important in the days of magazines, but in the online world with
notifications via RSS and twitter, I don’t see any reason to tie
myself to a schedule.</p>

<p>Usually when I go quiet for a few weeks, it’s due to travel. When I’m
on the grind of speaking I’m too busy, tired, and grumpy to do any
writing. But that’s not the reason for my recent quiet period, as I’ve
been happily at home. Indeed I’ve been working steadily at a couple
more <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Infodeck.html">infodecks</a>, and this involves both working on the content of
the infodecks and on the toolchain to build them. I’ve added more
features to the toolchain in addition to what I had for the
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/multiMobile">multi-mobile deck</a>, which should provide a more dynamic experience.
I’ve been enjoying the mix of writing and building tools to support
that writing - and I expect to be publishing these infodecks after the
Christmas/New Year slowdown.</p>
