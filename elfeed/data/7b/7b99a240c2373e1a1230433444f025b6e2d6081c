<div><p>Sorry about <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/Heres10ThingsIDidBeforeIWroteThisBlogPostTitleWhatHappenedNextWillShockYou.aspx">the title, I had to</a>. ;)</p> <p>I was running Windows and Google Chrome and I clicked on a link to an Upworthy.com video. When I go to Upworthy recently (don't judge me) I've been seeing this weird font for the last few months. It's obnoxious, and I was surprised they'd let this fly.</p> <p><img title="Upworthy has weird fonts" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Upworthy has weird fonts" src="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/I-was-a.you-wont-believe-what-I-did-next_E5C1/image_bcf95af2-94e7-498d-8643-eef8b236d483.png" width="642" height="251"></p> <p>Later, though, I looked in another browser, and it looked fine.</p> <p><img title="Upworthy rendered in IE" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Upworthy rendered in IE" src="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/I-was-a.you-wont-believe-what-I-did-next_E5C1/image_45ef4220-779a-4be7-8178-afd13ecdabdb.png" width="642" height="242"></p> <p>Ok, time to F12. According to IE's Developer Tools there are three webfonts coming down and they each are downloading completely.</p> <p><img title="IE dev tools say the WOFF file is fine" style="display: inline" alt="IE dev tools say the WOFF file is fine" src="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/I-was-a.you-wont-believe-what-I-did-next_E5C1/image_15df5ed3-ff7c-477f-ae84-a7f4fc88a622.png" width="816" height="65"></p> <p>Interestingly Chrome says the same thing:</p> <p><img title="Chrome agrees" style="display: inline" alt="Chrome agrees" src="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/I-was-a.you-wont-believe-what-I-did-next_E5C1/image_c631ca52-68fb-4505-8447-268dbff1fee0.png" width="664" height="133"></p> <p>What's the DOM expecting the font to be? Well, basically all of them. ;)</p> <p><img title="That's a long font-family" style="display: inline" alt="That's a long font-family" src="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/I-was-a.you-wont-believe-what-I-did-next_E5C1/image_30a6c7fe-5976-4122-aa9c-6dcb55501639.png" width="453" height="37"></p> <p>Seriously, though, IMHO pick a font or font family and move on. There's really no need to make a list of 11 font types in the order you'd prefer them. Either your web font works or it's Helvetica time.</p> <p>Gill Sans? I don't see a Gill Sans available here. Gill Sans is a Mac OS X system font, but it seems that Google Chrome on Windows REALLY don't like being asked for it. ;)</p> <p>I took each of the downloaded WOFF files and tried to open them at <a title="http://www.pkmurphy.com.au/glyphviewer/" href="http://www.pkmurphy.com.au/glyphviewer/">http://www.pkmurphy.com.au/glyphviewer/</a> to see if one was Gill Sans. Of course, none contained any of the first their fonts they're asking for. Unless you explicitly download a web font, a list of fonts like these are a just a designer's wish list. </p> <blockquote> <p>Web Designers: Design for the web, not the cool fonts you have on your machine.</p></blockquote> <p>On 99% of Windows machines you're going to end up with Segoe UI with this CSS font-family as most folks won't have those first three fonts. It seems that Chrome gives up (?) after a few tries (not sure?) but if I remove Gill Sans as the first item it renders fine.</p> <p><img title="image" style="display: inline" alt="image" src="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/I-was-a.you-wont-believe-what-I-did-next_E5C1/image_2add352a-9279-4314-8a84-6618c3106df2.png" width="365" height="106"></p> <p><img title="The font is correct with a smaller font-family" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="The font is correct with a smaller font-family" src="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/I-was-a.you-wont-believe-what-I-did-next_E5C1/image_2606bfa1-eae4-47ee-8086-e4d743363ec2.png" width="642" height="242"></p> <p>I tried to find a bug on this in the Chromium bug database...I'm <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=237050">not sure if it might be this one</a>?</p> <p>I hope a CSS person at Upworthy sees this and solves the mystery!
