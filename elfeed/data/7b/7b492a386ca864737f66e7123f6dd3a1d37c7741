<p>Time for a progress report on <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/NosqlDistilled.html">NoSQL Distilled</a>. We’ve done a
round of technical review and are now pretty happy with the text,
happy enough to move it into production. </p>

<p>Production for a book these days is both more complicated and more
responsive than it used to be. The next step on the book text is to do
copy-editing and indexing. It sounds like we are going to get the <a href="http://www.kirsanov.com/">same
people</a> I worked with on <a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/dsl.html">my DSL book</a>, which will be
excellent news since they did a good job and were happy to work directly
on the XML source in my repository. This simplifies and speeds up the
whole process. They will also do the book design and convert the book
in camera-ready for printing the physical books.</p>

<p>I suspect, however, that this book will see more electronic copies
than physical ones. In parallel with the copy-editing we’ll be
preparing the electronic copies. We intend to do a rough-cut version
of the book as soon as we can. This should be available through
<a href="http://www.informit.com/authors/bio.aspx?a=8877bf0c-92bd-4d0d-8317-d67fe8b88eee">InformIT</a>, Amazon, and <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com">Safari</a>. I’ll make further announcements here
as these become visible. </p>
