<p>Here is <a href="http://assets.thoughtworks.com/podcast/is-tdd-dead-episode-1-09-may-2014.mp3">an audio version of our first hangout</a>, for those of you who, like me, can’t stand watching video. It’s a raw translation of the video’s audio. We may try to do something more refined later, such as sorting out a podcast feed, but it’s not something we’ve done before so it may take a while for us to get around to it. </p>
