<p>Primum non nocere, or &#8220;first, do no harm&#8221; is a universal principle among healthcare professionals worldwide. It essentially means this: given a (bad) situation, your first priority is to not make it <em>worse</em> through your actions. Doctors hold a position of power over their patients. Most patients are unqualified to diagnose and treat themselves, so they must trust the education, experience, and skill of the doctor. A doctor can significantly (even terminally) affect a patient&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>I propose &#8220;first, do no harm&#8221; as a principle to apply in every situation where the do-er has a position of power over those his or her actions affect. Like managers.</p>

<p>Managers hold a position of power in an organization. A manager having a bad day can make a decision that changes the course of years of multiple people&#8217;s lives. A managerial decision can destroy morale, burn people out, or even ruin another person&#8217;s career.</p>

<p>Couple this power with the typical human need  to <em>do something</em>, and we have a problem on our hands.  As people, we grow anxious when we&#8217;re in a position in which we don&#8217;t feel we&#8217;re actively doing anything. Especially for new managers, this can drive a person crazy.  You&#8217;re used to being the producer who gets things done, and suddenly you&#8217;re in meetings and you aren&#8217;t the one producing anymore.  How do you measure your productivity?</p>

<p>In the worst case, you base it on something like the number of decisions you make or the number of processes you change.</p>

<p>Try to remember the last time you were in a job and things got screwed up because a manager was out of the office.  Now try to remember the last time things were screwed up because of an offhand comment, a sarcastic remark, a poorly timed email, or a decision some manager made.</p>

<p>At a tactical level, the risks of managerial action far outweigh the risks of inaction.</p>

<p>Therefore, managers&#8211;especially you first-time new managers, please don&#8217;t feel pressured to just <em>do something</em>. Be reasoned and careful when you encounter a new problem.</p>

<p>Rule number one is: First, do no harm.</p>
