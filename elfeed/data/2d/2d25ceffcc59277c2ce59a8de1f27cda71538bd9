<p>I just released version 1.4 of Circe, a Client for IRC in Emacs.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/circe/">Homepage</a></li></ul> <p>The package is available from github and MELPA unstable, even   though the latter will track further development changes, so use at   your own risk.</p> <p>Due to <a href="http://blog.jorgenschaefer.de/2014/06/the-sorry-state-of-emacs-lisp-package.html">the sorry state of Emacs Lisp package archives</a>, I am <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JorgenSch%C3%A4fer/posts/BxVcb9Vpo1f">currently unable to do an actual release</a> of Circe.</p> <a name="more"></a> <h2>Changes</h2> <ul>  <li>Non-blocking TLS connections. Circe now supports secure TLS     connections to IRC servers without blocking during the connect.     (Thanks to defanor for the patches!)</li>  <li>PEP (Python Enhancement Proposals) mentions are now buttonized     by default, like RFCs and SRFIs.</li>  <li>URLs are now buttonized with the logic from the built-in     thingatpt.el library.</li>  <li>Topic changes are highlighted correctly. Before, Circe would     show diffs for topics one older than the last.</li>  <li>Circe will now try a random nick when the server says that the     initial nick is erraneous. This could happen when the server set a     collision-avoiding nick, and Circe tried to retain it after a     reconnect.</li>  <li>The lui-logging module can now easily be enabled or disabled     globally.</li>  <li>The new option <tt>circe-server-buffer-name</tt> can be used to     influence the name of the server buffer, especially useful for     people using the same bouncer for multiple networks. This can also     be set on a per-network basis.</li></ul>
