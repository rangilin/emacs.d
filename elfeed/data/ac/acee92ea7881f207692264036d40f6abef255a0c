<p>I will give a 3 days training in Nantes on how to extend Emacs with
elisp. If there is interest I can talk also about org meta programming
with org babel. The training date is from June, 30 to July, 2. I will
speak in french (or English if everyone is comfortable with it).</p>

<p>The maximum number of attendees will be six in order to have a convivial
atmosphere and that no-one feels left out.</p>

<p>I feel that talking about coding is more fun while showing how to solve
concrete example. You are encouraged to bring material that you are
trying to solve. My goal is to show you how to make Emacs do what you
want it to do, while learning elisp programming.</p>

<p>The training cost is 1,800 euros (tax included). If you are an employee
in a french company you can use your OPCA to pay for it.</p>

<p>The following is the link to the web page outlining the training in
french :</p>
