<p>A common question for people in mobile development is to how to deal
with the wide range of mobile devices available. Do we have to write
native applications for every single device? Or is there a way to
reuse code for similar applications. Iâ€™ve written an infodeck to
explore this problem and suggest how to think about dealing with it.</p>
