<p>Well I have finally wiped my Windows partition. I use Windows for two
things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating my resume in Word format</li>
<li>Checking how Internet Explorer munges my web pages</li>
</ul>

<p>I have tried <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/">CrossOver Office Standard</a> and I must say I am hooked and
have bought the product. It saves me a lot of time and is a snap to
install. I can now use these tools without having to waste time
rebooting my computer. I really encourage people to
<a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/site/products/download_trial/">check out the trial version</a>.</p>
