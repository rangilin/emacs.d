<p>As I mentioned recently, <a href="http://chadfowler.com/blog/2013/01/08/moving-to-berlin-and-auf-wiedersehen-to-friends/">we&#8217;ve moved to Berlin!</a>.  We got to spend a week of down time exploring the city.  We are definitely in love with Berlin so far!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited today to finally announce that I&#8217;ve joined <a href="http://www.6wunderkinder.com/blog/willkommen-chad">6Wunderkinder</a> as CTO. In case you don&#8217;t know them by the company name, 6Wunderkinder are the creators of the extremely popular <a href="http://www.wunderlist.com">Wunderlist</a>, which is a cross-platform, simple, and beautiful productivity application.  I&#8217;m a user, and as I&#8217;ve told friends and family about my move, I&#8217;ve discovered that many of you are too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/techflash/2013/02/former-svp-chad-fowler-on-the-state-of.html">As I&#8217;ve said previously,</a>, I&#8217;ll miss my LivingSocial team and look forward to watching them from here in Berlin, but I&#8217;m extremely excited to get back to hands-on software development with the small, focused, team of brilliant product engineers here at 6Wunderkinder.</p>

<p>For those in the Berlin tech scene, if you happen to see me around at <a href="http://www.sanktoberholz.de/">Sankt Oberholz</a>, please do stop by and say hi :)</p>
