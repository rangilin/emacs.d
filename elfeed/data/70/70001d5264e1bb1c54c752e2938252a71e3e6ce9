<p>Here&#8217;s an exercise you can put into place right now which will have a lasting, significant, positive effect on your life
and the lives of those you work, live, collaborate, and play with. There are two versions: an easy version and a harder version. Start with the easy
version unless you&#8217;re the kind of person who has to do things the hard way.</p>

<h2>The easy version</h2>

<p>Whenever you have a cynical thought, keep it to yourself. Never utter, write, or otherwise convey it. Put it away. Think it to yourself all day if you have to, but never express it.</p>

<h2>The harder version</h2>

<p>Whenever you have a cynical thought, keep it to yourself. Analyze it. Scrutinize it. Prove it to be wrong. Discover the personal fear within you from which it grew, and make a plan to address that fear
fully. Be thankful to the negative emotion for giving you the opportunity to understand your own weaknesses.</p>

<p>Cynicism is born of laziness and fear: It&#8217;s easy to complain about something. It&#8217;s harder to fix it. It&#8217;s both scary and liberating to trust other people to try to be their best.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">@dhh</a> pointed out on Twitter after I posted this, I worded this more absolutely than intended. I meant this to be an &#8220;exercise&#8221; (see the first sentence). Skepticism is healthy. Sometimes, cynicism is the right reaction. But, I believe most of us could use a lot less of it.</p>
