<p>ThoughtWorks is organizing an <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/events/spend-day-martin-fowler-neal-ford-other-agile-thought-leaders">Agile East</a> event: a one day
conference that we’re holding in New York (November 2) and Atlanta
(November 7). I’ll be speaking, doing my usual <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html">suite of
talks</a>. More importantly there’s an impressive line up of my
colleagues - the people whose ideas I clip and package up into those
talks. So this is a great opportunity to listen to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Graham and Andy talk from their experiences in the
technical leadership of agile projects</li>
  <li>project management lessons from Joe Z</li>
  <li>hot devops and continuous delivery juice from Rolf and Jez</li>
  <li>Ross’s advice on IT budgeting</li>
  <li>Linda’s take on integrating UX with an agile project</li>
  <li>Matt on using offshore teams for agile (he played a big role
 in building our offshore teams)</li>
  <li>a trio of talks on the gnarly topic of organizational change from Tiffany, Greg and Manu</li>
  <li>Chad explaining how to avoid the pitfalls of automated tests</li>
</ul>

<p>and a special guest in New York who will make all our
talks seem pedestrian.</p>
