<p>My hard disk crashed; that's not a big deal as I make backups
frequently. The problem is I didn't have any rescue disk to get to my
backup.</p>

<p>I had to install Windows to get to the Internet, download and burn a
Gentoo CD. This is embarrassing when I bragged a while back that I got
rid of Windows!</p>

<p>Next my backup was on a firewire device, and it was a headache to get
to. I booted the Gentoo CD with <code>gentoo dofirewire</code>. I then typed the
following command to get to my external drive.</p>

<pre class="example">
modprobe sbp2 spb2_serialize_io=1
echo &quot;scsi add-single-device 0 0 0&quot; &gt; /proc/scsi/scsi
</pre>

<p>My drive needs the <code>spb2_serialize_io</code> set to <code>1</code> or it won't work.</p>

<p>I have learned that it's not enough to make backup. I need to make
a rescue CD so that I don't waste time recovering my system.</p>
