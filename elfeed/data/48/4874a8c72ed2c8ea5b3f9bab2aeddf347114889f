  I use these two literally all the time. The first one removes
  trailing whitespace and replaces all tabs with spaces before save.

<p>
  The last one I've got on a key - it also indents the entire buffer.

  These might not be for everybody. Sometimes you do want tabs (I'm looking at
  you <code>Makefile</code> <em>grrrrr</em>). Then this isn't optimal.
  The same can be said for when Emacs doesn't indent correctly. But
  that is a horrid, unacceptable situation in any case. I always fix
  those as soon as I can.
