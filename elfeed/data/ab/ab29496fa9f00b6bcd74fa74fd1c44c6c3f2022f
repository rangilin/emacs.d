<p>When any serious app is 100% done, there’s another 50% left to do, and
that 50% is deployment. For complicated or large apps, there’s no easy
way to do this.</p>

<p>A reader asked me about Elixir and deployment:</p>

<blockquote><p>There is definitely a lot of excitement around Elixir and I like<br/>it. What I am concerned with is are their any<br/>production deployment issues with Elixir? I have not don’t one myself<br/>but Elixir depends a lot on Erlang and Erlang libraries which have<br/>some kind of unique release process or so I have been told. I am not<br/>sure if I understood it correctly but I believe Erlang is released in<br/>such a away that it is self reliant and doesn’t depend on any external<br/>dependencies. How would Elixir behave if the system Erlang version<br/>moves ahead?</p></blockquote>


<p>And I responded:</p>

<p>Elixir is just Erlang, as far as Erlang is concerned. This means
that Elixir code can be deployed alongside Erlang code—the two
coexist.</p>

<p>However, you have to be careful when looking at
Erlang deployments.  Up until now, these have tended to be
large-scale, distributed, and highly redundant systems. The goal has
been seriously high reliability. Now no system like this can be
deployed just by pushing a button—there’s a lot of planning, and a lot
of configuration and scripting.</p>

<p>As a result, a “classical” Erlang deploy can be a big
beast. Your Elixir code can join in this fun if it wants to.</p>

<p>But Elixir also offers simpler options. For example, deploying an
Erlixir web app to Heroku is just about as easy as deploying any app
to Heroku—just push to a repository.</p>

<p>So the short answer is that deployment in any language is not just one
topic—it varies greatly depending on the application’s
characteristics. At the large scale end, Erlang (and by
extension Elixir) has a great story—it is mature and proven. At the
small scale, deployments such as Heroku make it easy. And in the
middle—well, that’s where the interesting stuff will happen.</p>
