<p>I am one of the original organizers of both <a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> and <a href="http://railsconf.com">RailsConf</a>.  Combined, I&#8217;ve organized or been on the program committee for around 25 conferences.  I&#8217;ve read hundreds of proposals and seen hundreds of conference talks.</p>

<p>Occasionally, a proposal or a talk stands out. Here&#8217;s one that I still think of when new would-be speakers ask how to get their first talk accepted. When preparing for RailsConf 2010 in Baltimore, we received this email from <a href="https://twitter.com/r00k">Ben Orenstein</a>:</p>

<p>Ben had never spoken at a conference before, and he knew we had a lot of proposals to consider.  Here&#8217;s what I like about his email (and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg33EQCdMxw">video</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Most important, he showed us how enthustiastic he to give the talk. Enthusiasm is one of the most sorely lacking features of technical conference talks. When someone is excited, I am more engaged.</li>
<li>He reassured us that, though we might not have heard of him before, he was qualified to give the subject a good treatment.</li>
<li>He told us he was going to be prepared when the conference rolled around. It&#8217;s rare that a conference presenter explicitly says &#8220;I am going to be ready&#8221;.</li>
<li>He went to the trouble to make a video which showed us both what his style might be like in person and again that he really wanted this opportunity to speak.</li>
</ul>


<p>I immediately looked up his proposal, and as you might guess it was as thoughtful and energetic as the email and video.</p>

<p>I then sent my <a href="http://benscofield.com/">conference co-chair, Ben Scofield</a>, the following email:</p>

<p>And his response:</p>

<p>This is surely only one way to get a talk accepted, but as a new presenter, it&#8217;s a good example to consider.</p>

<p>(You can hear a conversation between me and Ben about this proposal and more at the <a href="http://learn.thoughtbot.com/podcast/44">Giant Robots Podcast</a>.)</p>
