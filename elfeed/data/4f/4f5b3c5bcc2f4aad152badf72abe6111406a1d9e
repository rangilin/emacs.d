who has been heavily involved in the development of our approaches to
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/delivery.html">Continuous Delivery</a>. Recently he gave a series of QTB (Quarterly
Technology Briefing) talks and <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/events/push-the-button">one of these was videoed</a> and
put on the ThoughtWorks site. It’s an excellent overview of why it’s
important to learn how to do Continuous Delivery on the modern web,
together with an overview of the practices needed to achieve it.</p>
