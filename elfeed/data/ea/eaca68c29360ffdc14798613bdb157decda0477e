<p>Tired of seeing stale dired buffers?</p>

<p>Auto revert mode looks for changes to files, and updates them for you.</p>

<p>
  With these settings, dired buffers are also updated. The last
  setting makes sure that you're not alerted every time this happens.
  Which is every time you save something.
