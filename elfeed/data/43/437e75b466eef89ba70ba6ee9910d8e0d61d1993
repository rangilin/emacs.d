<p>
It's actually pretty easy, but worth noting:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">ssh ec2-user@ec2machine
sudo yum install xauth xeyes
<span style="color: #f92672;">exit</span>

ssh -X ec2-user@ec2machine
xeyes
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In short, the magic's in installing Xauth and then re-logging in with
the <code>ssh -X</code> flag.
</p>

<p>
And I admit, xeyes isn't strictly necessary, but I find it's a nice,
lightweight confirmation that both display and mouse are working as
expected.
