<p>The typesetting is done but it's an absolute nightmare to make the
booklet. My advice so far is to no use cd-cover for a booklet because
it won't re arrange the pages as needed. I have a document that's the
size of a CD. I need to find a program that re arranges the pages so I
can make the booklet. I have tried <code>psnuple</code>, <code>ps2ps</code> and <code>impose+</code> without
much luck.</p>
