<p>
This evening I saw a man who was incredibly buff. Take the fittest
I'll ever be in my life, and he was far, far fitter at 60. He was so
toned he could easily have been a world-class yoga teacher. He wasn't
a world-class yoga teacher. He was a world-class musician. He was
Sting.

<p>
Sometimes I feel inadequate.
</p>

<p>
I pray to God.
</p>

<p>
I say, "God, sometimes I feel inadequate."
</p>

<p>
"That's okay," says God. "That's why I created Tom Jones. He's being
awesome enough for everyone."
</p>

<p>
He's right.
</p>

<p>
"Have a Gin &amp; Tonic," says God.
</p>

<p>
He's right again.
