<p>I use xscreensaver to blank out my monitor when it's not in use. I got
annoyed that my screen would activate for no particular reason.</p>

<p>I have made a patch to fix this problem. It will prevent the screen
from activating when someone bumps your desk or wind blows on your
touch pad, etc ...</p>

<p>It works by ignoring small cursor motion. It does the job
for my laptop, maybe someone else will find it useful.</p>
