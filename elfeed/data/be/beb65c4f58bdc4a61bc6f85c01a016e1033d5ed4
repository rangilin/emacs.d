Anonther <a href="http://www.meetup.com/West-London-Hack-Night/events/130356642/">West London Hack Night</a>, and another success I'd say. We
picked a tough one this time: Write an interpreter and a virtual
machine in 90 minutes. That challenge was made both easier and harder
by the choice of language: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a>. It's got a very simple
specification, but the language is so hard to read that debugging the
interpreter becomes a real brain&#x2026;ache.

By my count we mustered 20 people spread across 7 teams. Not everyone
managed to finish, but here are the projects that got published:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/denchev/brainfuck-php">PHP</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/Roysvork/6251663">C#</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dpdawson/ruby-brainfuck">Ruby</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/funkotron/brainfuck">Clojure</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adamretter/Skullfuck">Scala</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pljones/brain/blob/master/brainfuck.html">JavaScript</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Not a bad result at all - almost everyone went home able to say they'd
implemented a Turing Complete programming language from scratch&#x2026;
