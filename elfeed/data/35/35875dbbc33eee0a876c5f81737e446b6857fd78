If you have a
subscription that supports rough cuts you will see the whole book, if
not you’ll see a preview of the book with the table of contents and
the first paragraph or two from each section. Remember this is a rough
cut and has not been copy edited.</p>

<p>I was a bit hesitant to announce this, after my false sighting on
Tuesday, but I’ve had a few tweets now confirming that it’s online.</p>
