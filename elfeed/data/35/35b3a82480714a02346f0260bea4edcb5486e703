<p>One of the great frustrations of the software industry is that we donâ€™t have properly built studies to figure out whether development tools and techniques such as object-oriented programming, test-driven development, or even high-level languages are good for us. Regularly we see improperly built studies that do so - often these are done poorly because they rely on a bogus measure of productivity (such as Lines of Code per staff day). 10 years ago today, my frustration led me to publish my bliki post <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html">CannotMeasureProductivity</a>. I think this post is sadly just as sound today as it was a decade ago.</p>
