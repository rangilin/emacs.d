<p>I never realised how useful this program is. I have been playing with
CVS emacs and various version of mplayer. Stow makes it easy to juggle
between different version of the same program.</p>

<p>Put the following in your <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>

<pre class="example">
function stow
{
command stow --dir=$HOME/local/stow $*
}

function unstow
{
command stow --dir=$HOME/local/stow -D $*
}
</pre>

<p>Here is how to stow mplayer:</p>

<pre class="example">
./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/stow/mplayer107
make
make install
stow mplayer107
</pre>

<p>Note that mplayer is neatly tucked in it's own directory. Stow creates
a symlink to mplayer at <code>~/local/bin/mplayer</code> so you need to only have
<code>~/local/bin</code> in your path.</p>

<p>Say that you compiled an earlier version of mplayer 106, switching
from one version to the other is very easy:</p>

<pre class="example">
unstow mplayer107
stow mplayer106
</pre>

<p>I hope I have convinced you that using stow is a good idea, installing
different software in the same location becomes unmanageable.</p>
