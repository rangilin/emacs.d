<p>Today is VCD fun! So what is VCD? It's something that the Chinese have
invented as a substitute to DVD. Why is it so interesting?  You can
burn your movies on a regular CD-ROM and watch them on your DVD
player.</p>

<p>So, let's get the tool:</p>

<p><code>apt-get install vcdtools</code></p>

<p>I used an MPEG1 movie of dimension 384x288 with a bitrate of 1152
KBit/sec and an audiostream with a sample rate of 44100 Hz, stereo and
a bitrate of 224 KBit/sec. Let's call this file <code>movie.mpg</code>.</p>

<p>Next I create the VCD file with the following command:</p>

<p><code>mkvcdfs movie.mpg</code></p>

<p>Next you will need to burn the file with <code>cdrdao</code>. I had a bit of a
headache here because the version that comes with Debian testing
doesn't yet support the new IDE interface that comes with Linux 2.6. I
grabbed and manually installed version 1.1.7-5 in unstable and it
works fine.</p>

<p>Now i am blanking my CD-RW:</p>

<p><code>cdrdao blank --save --driver generic-mmc --device /dev/hdb</code></p>

<p>Note that adding the <code>--save</code> parameter will save the options in a file
called <code>.cdrdao</code> in your home directory. In effect, you don't need to
specify the driver and the device on the command line.</p>

<p>Next I burn my movie:</p>

<p><code>cdrdao write vcd.toc</code></p>

<p>I pop that CD in my DVD player and the movie looks great.  I am
pleased!</p>

<p>I if use a movie encoded in NTSC, it plays back in black and white and
I am not sure why</p>
