As a programmer, the text editor is the core tool in your
world. Regardless of platform, language or environment, almost
everything you write will go through your editor of choice. And I'm
here to tell you folks: chances are, your text editor is the wrong
tool for the job. Here's why&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
Most text editors are built to support a writer's workflow. And a
writer's workflow looks like this: Start a new document, append lots
of text, then later on, jump around a little &amp; tweak:
</p>

<p>
<div class="thumbnail"><img src="/files/append-centric-editor.png" alt="Append-Centric Editor"/></div>
</p>

<p>
The amount of jumping will vary depending on the writer, but the
workflow is essentially insert-centric. A tiny bit of time is spent
moving the cursor, the vast majority spent entering new text.
</p>

<p>
And that's the model that pretty much every text editor out there is
built on. Notepad &amp; Word are built for writers, but so is the editor
in Eclipse, Xcode, IDEA &amp; every other IDE I've ever seen. The workflow
is insert-centric, and any other features are just tacked onto a menu
at the top:
</p>

<p>
<div class="thumbnail"><img src="/files/fancy-insert-centric-editor.png" alt="Fancy Insert-Centric Editor"/></div>
</p>

<p>
But we're not writers! We're programmers. Our workflow is completely
different. We spend very little time appending large chunks of new
text. We spend most of it jumping between functions, adding a bit
here, jumping there, deleting a few lines and moving them over to a
different file. We leap around, chopping, changing, expanding the code
all the day:
</p>

<p>
<div class="thumbnail"><img src="/files/manipulation-centric-editor.png" alt="Manipulation-Centric Editor"/></div>
</p>

<p>
No editor designed for writers will ever support a workflow like that
well. And (almost) every editor is either designed for writers, or an
extension of one that was. Adding more menu items to a fundamentally
wrong workflow doesn't solve the problem. We need an editor that isn't
insert-centric. We need one that's manipulation-centric. An editor
that assumes very little of our time will be spent inserting en-masse,
and that most of it will be spent jumping around, tweaking, expanding
and refining. We need an editor that assumes multiple files at once is
the norm. We need an editor that makes changing five scattered
sentences at least as easy as entering one new paragraph. The writer's
editor will not achieve this, no matter how many menu items it has.
</p>

<p>
If your editor sends you to a mouse to select a paragraph, it's not
good enough. If it expects you to edit one file at a time, it's not
good enough. If jumping between two related functions in two separate
files requires a mouse, it's not good enough. In short, if your editor
doesn't make movement a first-class citizen, it's not good enough.
</p>

<p>
There is at least one solution to this problem. There is at least one
editor that's designed, from the ground up, for a programmer's
workflow. But I'm trying to avoid mentioning it, because this post
isn't about converting people to my favourite editor. It's about the
fact that most editors aren't designed for us, and that we need a
solution.
</p>

<p>
There are two and a half types of editor. Editors designed for
writers. Editors designed for writers, with dozens of functions tacked
onto the menu system. And editors actually designed for
programmers. Whichever one you pick, please make sure you've picked it
deliberately.
</p>


<p>
PS: Okay, my chosen editor is Vim. It addresses a programmer's
workflow beautifully. But this isn't a pro-Vim rant. It's a workflow
plea. You don't have to pick my solution, but I hope you see the
problem &amp; go looking for a solution.
</p>

<p>
PPS: Some of my colleagues think I'm anti-IDE. I'm not. I just keep
coming back to the editor. Having an Integrated Development
Environment is nice. Integration is a lovely thing. But having an
editor designed for programming is essential. I'll give up integration
for that, every time.
