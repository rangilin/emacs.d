I've been using 24.4 for months now, yet only today I came to
realise the <code>*Messages*</code> buffer has been granted <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/messages-buffer-mode.html">its own major-mode</a>. The
practical difference is that the buffer is now read-only and has a
non-writing-oriented key-map.

<p>
God-only knows how many times I've fruitlessly hit <kbd>q</kbd> while trying to
quit the buffer, so the change is welcome.
