<p>Did you know you could add label to ext2or ext3partitions? I didn't
know till today. Extract from the man page of <code>tune2fs</code>:</p>

<pre class="example">
-L volume-label
        Set  the   volume  label  of   the  filesystem.    Ext2
        filesystem labels can be at most 16 characters long; if
        volume-label   is longer  than 16  characters,  tune2fs
        will truncate it and print a warning.  The volume label
        can  be used  by mount(8),  fsck(8),  and /etc/fstab(5)
        (and possibly  others) by specifying LABEL=volume_label
        instead of a block special device name like /dev/hda5.
</pre>

<p>That's good because when I run <code>cfdisk</code> I won't need to look at
/etc/fstabat the same time to figure what partition maps to what. (I
tend to have lots of partitions.)</p>
